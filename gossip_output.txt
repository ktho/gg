She's had the ponds and the fish for many years, but hasn't had great luck with her pumps. They all seem to last one season (spring through fall), and then they just quit, and she ends up having to buy a new one. They are not always that cheap, either.Does anyone have any good recommendations for a model or brand that seems to be reliable and lasts?It needs to run 24/7 during spring, summer, and fall. She wants a pump that does 7,000 gallons per hour. The pond is about 10x10 ft and contains 1,000 gallons of water in it. The pond also has a waterfall, so the pump needs to also power the waterfall."		I've been fancying With the idea of buying fb stocks for a while now that the price is still below IPO.

Since joining on March 2nd, Alex has chimed in over 20 times on Yabbly! Talk about a power Yabbler!Q. Tell us about yourself!Well, more than a lot of things, I am a geek at heart. As a producer/videographer I spend a lot of time in front of a computer editing videos, writing scripts and animating graphic. I also build civilian drones, so I spend a lot of my time flying, fixing and adding features to my drones (unmanned aerial vehicle). I am the other half of a team that makes On Screen Displays and other tools for prosumer UAVs. I also host the Urban Drones show on uStream where a live feed a drone is broadcasted live and other drone enthusiasts watch the live feed, ask questions and participate in the show by sharing their knowledge and tips. Aside from that, I've been working on bringing an iPhone5 case to market via crowd funding. I'm hoping that this case will help people take better looking pictures and video.Q.  Everyone is busy these days.  Why did Yabbly make it on to your list of places to spend time?About 80% of my shopping happens online; Even if an item is offered locally, I get a weird satisfaction out of getting it from a website. So I spend a big part of my shopping time reading customers reviews. I think Yabbly makes the review reading process a little bit more personal because in a way, you get to understand a little bit more the point of view of the reviewer and get to participate and understand the reason why that person gave a thumbs up or down to a particular product.Continued at http://blog.yabbly.com/2013/03/11/meet-alex-yabbler-of-the-week/"		"What products / books are out there for parents looking for a way to better communicate with their kids about their future (i.e. college, ca"	reer)?		"Tip:  If you use a cheaper VOIP conference bridge/speaker-mic at work at have bad sound quality, put something under it.

"Gut instinct tells me that they will gradually perform better from this point onward. Despite their post-IPO performance, Facebook is actually still in a very good position to monetize the mobile user base, considering that they already won half the mobile battle in terms of having millions (and increasing amount) of users who spend combined millions of minutes on their mobile site/app every single day. That's a lot of quality impression. All they have left is to figure the other half of the battle, executing a great monetization strategy (ads or no ads) on these users which will drive up their stock price.

"Right now, we're feeling pretty good about how to keep people updated about threads they've started or participated in (especially after we ship our new notifications center for mobile web and iPhone app).  However, one thing we've not been as good at is letting Yabblers know when a new thread is published that is probably of interest to them.  We include some of these in our weekly email digest but that's often after the thread has gone a bit stale.Any feedback on the idea of sending the app a push notification or sending non-app users an email if a really awesome thread emerges that they've not seen or participated in yet?Clearly, the spam risk is huge so that's why we're asking first.  As an example, what if we only did this if it was in your most active topic category, it was from a Member who had provided you with a helpful answer to one of your questions in the past, we know you've not seen it yet, and we'd never notify you of more than 1 per day?Our gut feeling is this needs to be opt in and users need to set the criteria for when they get notified of new threads using a combo of who posts, topic, keywords, number of responses already, and max notifications/day.

"Link: http://store.thelaundress.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=1-DETThis may sound a little odd coming from a dude but I've never had to go to a dry cleaner thanks to their products. Their specialized laundry detergents are made from natural biodegradable ingredients without any harsh toxic chemicals, like ones typically used in the dry cleaning process or ones found in your standard detergent (their detergent is soap-like and safe to touch), meaning they'll be gentle to the fabric of your garments and won't cause any fading. My clothes also usually come out smelling fresh and super clean.The only downside: their stuff is a little bit pricier than what you'll normally buy at stores, but you will get a generous amount of detergent per bottle. You can also check on Amazon for pretty high praises for their products.What I'm current using: Denim Wash, Black/White Wash, Signature Wash and Wash & Stain Bar."		"Looking for a privacy screen for a Macbook Air 11 laptop."""

It seemed that the lower voltage of rechargeable batteries AND the old Chemical Technology made them more vulnerable for self-depletion with time. So I read some reviews and bought Eneloops. These work almost the same as non-rechargeable penlite batteries (lasting for approx 1,5/2 months in my Mouse). And recharge in one evening.The question now is what rechargable batterie can last for the same 2-3 months in my Magic Mouse. Or which one is just the best price/quality combination.

"I grew up with a mom who juiced in the 80s, we needed a new blender, and I wanted something that would help me cook healthy whole foods quickly and easily with minimal clean up.  The Vitamix is really making me happy.  The clean up is as easy as they say which is so wonderful.  Just turn it on with some soapy water inside, rinse it out and it's clean!  In terms of nutrition, my kids ate asparagus soup last night.  While they will eat straight asparagus, they ate much more of it in soup form.The only downsides I can see so far are that you need ice to use it properly.  The motor moves so fast that it will actually heat your food after 5+ minutes of blending.  So if you want a cold drink/not to kill your nutrients, you need to include ice in the mix.If you want carrot/apple juice you have to buy a bag to squeeze the blended mixture through to get a juice that isn't thick because those two foods are so dry to begin with.  The other alternative is to put in a lot of water/ice in to thin it out.You can make quick frozen yogurt with frozen fruit and yogurt, or ice and fruit.  This is great for a quick and healthy"" dessert.  "					"It also chops which is something I hate to do manually.

Instead of your programs, applications, or data running on or being stored on your device, much of what happens takes place on the Internet.

What do I mean by devices?  Computers, tablets, smart-phones? pretty much anything that connects to the Internet.You are probably already using the ?Cloud? and did not even know it.  Most email services are cloud based.  Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, and Apple?s iCloud are cloud based email services.

"Congrats to @VincentBarr for being selected as our Yabbler of the Week. Vincent has chimed in on over 25 posts over the three months!Q. Tell us about yourself!I?m Vincent.Vincent is a late 20-something who writes autobiographies in the third person, really enjoys dancing (recreationally), once leaped from a ski lift as he realized he was headed back down the mountain, and lives in New York. He?s a curious person, interested in a lot of things, and vague, at times.Professionally, he spends his time on SEM with 10gen, maker of MongoDB, and in business development with Earndit, and exercise rewards app. He is a strong admirer of urban art, a lover of deep house, a recovering muralist, and recently calculated his Amazon Reading List to discover that it exceeds his lifespan. Bummer.His avatar is Calvin and Hobbes because ? you guessed it ? he really likes Calvin and Hobbes (and doesn?t like headshots).Q.  Everyone is busy these days.  Why did Yabbly make it on to your list of places to spend time?In a nutshell, I spend time on Yabbly because it helps me make good decisions. I trust the community, learn from it, and feel an odd sense of satisfaction when I?m answering a question that might be able to help someone else.When I first tinkered with Yabbly, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the community?s responses. For me, performing due diligence on product decisions and specific technology uses means 10-15 browser tabs open, mild frustration, and more questions. Yabbly dramatically reduces the time it takes me to gather information to make a good decision, and provides valuable recommendations and considerations that I might not have thought of. Few communities do that, and even fewer do it well.Continued... http://blog.yabbly.com/2013/03/03/meet-vincent-yabbler-of-the-week/"		Is there a way to change my screen name?

"Hi Folks, we're experimenting with a new service called Yabbly Concierge.  We used to call it Yabbly Buyer Research but that didn't seem very human or friendly.  Our current vision for Yabbly Concierge is to look at well-formed, relevant, and interesting questions from Members that have not gotten any helpful responses after one of two days.  In those instances, we will ask our Concierge team to do some online research across at least 3 different sources and see if they can lend a hand.We envision a world where 99% of Yabbler decisions are informed by fellow members of the community so think the YC as more of a velvet safety net than a core feature but it's still consistent with our mission of helping the world make great decisions and ensures that most Members will always get at least 1 helpful response within a day or so.Lastly, as the Community grows, our YC team may not be able to get to all member posts that haven't had a response after 1 day.  In those cases, we may take a little longer to jump in or may not be able to at all :-(  Hopefully that will be rare because we get to most or the Community hits the Needs Love feed.  However, in keeping with our Karma principles, we will give priority to Members with the highest Yabbly Karma (as a reminder, the best way to get Karma is to provide responses to people which are marked helpful by other members).Any thoughts?"		What should I buy a Samsung or Apple computer?

Tell us about yourself! I have been living in Roseburg Oregon the past two years and will be moving back to Olympia WA this week.  I lived in Colorado for 23 years.  Received a degree in Communication at Colorado State University in Fort Collins.  During those years I ski raced, pursued technical climbing and mountaineering after attending a mountaineering school in Vail run by a 10th Mountain Division alumni.  I also managed restaurants in Denver.I moved to Seattle in 1986 and worked in technology for 22 years.  These days my primary interests are nature photography, barbless catch and release fly fishing, hiking, cross county skiing, traveling the western US and  model railroading.Q.  Everyone is busy these days.  Why did Yabbly make it on to your list of places to spend time?Yabbly in essence it allows one to ?volunteer? or help others out with their areas of knowledge and interest.

Does anyone know anybody who works one-on-one with moms specifically? If I lived in New York I'd look into Julie Tupler of Lose the Mummy Tummy fame or someone trained by her. Is there someone like that in Seattle? Or maybe you think a training gym like crossfit would do the trick? Please offer your recommendations! Bonus if it's something that will easily work around my schedule as a stay at home mom of two young children - as in, can meet while the kids are at preschool (one two hour class per week) or with the babysitter (one morning per week) or at the crack of dawn before my husband goes to work (not my first choice), or in the late evening after he gets home, or they have provided childcare at a non nap time when we don't have dance class or swim lessons or bible study, or can come to my home in the afternoons at nap time (not ideal with space/noise issues)...

"My wife and I have about 1.25 acres to mow and we have been paying a lawn service to cut the grass and plow the driveway in the Winter.

We have researched Kubota, Kioti, John Deer and Cub Cadet and made a preliminary decision of a Kubota BX2660.http://www.kubota.com/product/BX1860/BX1860.aspx?We are planning to get the Front Loader which will push snow and dump it exactly where we want it as well as give the ability to lift and move a little over 500 pounds of landscaping/gardening material if needed.  We will eventually buy the grass plug attachment so we can aerate our lawn yearly and save the 150-200 Yearly cost.Does anyone have any experience with this type of purchase?  I do not want to just run down to Home Depot and get a made for manufacturer brand (knock off) and spent 2-4K to get something that will last 5-8 years.  I don't mind spending the extra money on something that will last 25-30 years with only routine maintenance and standard wear fixes.I hate the fact that we pay 200-250 Dollars a month from April to September for lawn service and another 350.00 per year on Snow Removal.  Plus the plow guys run off the darn driveway and damage the yard/run over light posts.  Kubota also has 60 months with 0% financing which helps ease the burdon of the purchase.Thank you my friends for any help.Jeff"		"Does anyone know of, or think there is great system development/Cloud talent in the south sound?"

That's a lot of daily quality impressions literally being handed over to FB. All they have left is to figure the other half of the battle, executing a great monetization strategy (ads or no ads) on these users which will drive up their stock price.

You?ve seen her around on Yabbly as @Lynn-experienced ? she's helped out on over 40 posts. Check out her profile (http://yabbly.com/profile/6714/lynn-experienced) to read about the best web design mockup tool, how to handle bedwetting kids, and recs on the best franchise to buy for <$100k. Congrats Lynn!Q. Tell us about yourself!I am a Research Psychologist.  Most people ask what that means.  It means I really like studying human behavior but prefer measurement and data over one-on-one counseling to help people.  My former classmates would certainly add that it was a good decision on my part as they have seen my counseling skills.  My husband and I run a small research and consulting firm for the senior living industry.  We have three kids, all with single digit ages.  In my spare time, I enjoy reading, exercising, planning events, and trying new recipes.Q. Everyone is busy these days.  Why did Yabbly make it on to your list of places to spend time?When the kids go to bed, I read or surf the internet.  One day I clicked on the Yabbly ad on Facebook and a friendship was born.  I really like helping people and often have to restrain myself from answering a Yabbly post when I don?t have what I think is a meaningful contribution.  And occasionally I find myself in the market for a new product, or just need an outside perspective on something, so I call on my fellow Yabblers for help.  It?s very interesting to read about all the decisions people are trying to make.  Sometimes I have no idea what a person is asking about, so I look up the product and learn something new.  For example, someone asked about ?Das keyboard?.  At first, I honestly thought she was writing with a Swedish accent.Read the rest at http://blog.yabbly.com/2013/04/22/heres-lynn-our-yabbler-of-the-week/"		#Fantasy football is fast approaching - what are your top 5 picks for a non-PPR (no keeper) league?	#Fantasy football is fast approaching - what are your top 5 picks for a non-PPR (no keeper) league?		My favorite place for athletic shoes went out of business.

I really like the fact that when one requests an invite, one has to instantly write a very detailed review, on the spot, of a product/service that they love. I think that can help somewhat to try to weed out some people. I know that when I really like something, I always tell ALL of my friends and family about it, so I?m always making recommendations and always helping people find things. I enjoy helping others, and if my advice can help them, all the better.

Lately, our milk has been going bad well before the sell by date (e.g. a 7 days before). I finally got frustrated by this and took it back to the store (Trader Joe's) and was told that my understanding of the sell by date is incorrect. I was told the milk is guaranteed to stay good up to one week after it is opened, not one week past the sell by date.I'm guessing this is prolly the correct definition of the sell by date, but I've never experienced so much milk going bad so early.

"Hi all,  I'm looking for recommendations on waterproof winter hiking boots for my wife and I.  We are casual hikers (a couple hours at most right now) and want to continue this in the winter.  We were told that waterproof boots and a pair of gaiters might be enough and we can expand to using snowshoes if we really get into this.    I'm looking for something that is warm enough to use in winter down to say 0 degrees F.  If I could continue to use them in fall and spring too that would be a plus.  Something on the lighter side would be good too.  Ankle support is a plus but I don't think I need anything that is shin high.  And, since this is for my wife too, nothing too ugly"" though I suppose that is entirely subjective.

Here's a way around it."	"Google announced a few months back that starting this year, they will no longer support Gmail via Exchange server or push notifications on iOS. What this means for you is if you're a Gmail user on iOS, receiving Gmail through the Mail.app will only be through fetch.Current Gmail users who have Exchange set up will still receive push notifications, but once you buy another iOS device, you will lose access to Exchange.There are 4 ways around this: 1. Use the Gmail app for iOS. This app is the only app that is guaranteed to provide push notification of your Gmail inbox.2. Purchase a Google for Business subscription. This will maintain your access to Google's Exchange email service.3. Dump your Gmail. Not a great decision especially if you archive all of your mail on the service. Most of all, changing what may be your primary email address is a HUGE inconvenience.4. The Big Workaround: Next, I will detail how to get around all of this so you can get push notification of incoming emails by transparently moving to a new service and still get to use your Gmail account.If you have an iOS device, you have an iCloud email address. Go to the Gmail website and open Settings > Forwarding and POP/IMAP > Forwarding. Click on Add a Forwarding Address"" then input and verify your iCloud email address. Once verified, select ""Forward a copy of incoming mail to"" and choose your iCloud address in the dropdown menu.

"We?re excited to introduce a new feature that will make it much easier to mention and identify other Yabblers in a post or response!  Imagine you see a post for which you know another Yabbler might have a great response, or you are composing a new tip and want to make sure another Yabbler sees your great choice. The first step to make that possible was to make it easier to identify members. Today, we?ve launched unique MemberNames to make that a reality, so you can claim your name today (lots of first names are still available)!If you noticed your username was updated since the last time you logged in, that?s probably because you had a duplicate name. We used to allow duplicate names (we had literally dozens of Michaels) but that won?t really work if someone wants to tag one specific Michael in a post or response. To straighten-out this whole mess we had to assign placeholder names, so we added Yabbly adjectives like ?thoughtful,? ?helpful? or ?empowered? to remove duplicates. Best of all, if you like your MemberName, you don?t have to do anything: You can keep the name we?ve already assigned to you or update it if you think of something better that?s available. Just go to the preferences page from the Yabbly website (it?s the little gear icon at the top right of the page).  While you?re there, please add a bio as well so your fellow Yabblers know a little more about you!Let us know what you think and we apologize for the inconvenience to all the Michaels out there!"		"Meet @Jim, our Yabbler of the Week!"

Tell us about yourself!I am a nerd of a few varieties.  I?m a software engineer, so I spend most of my life in front of a computer.  Or iPad.  Or cellphone. I started programming back in the day on my trusty old TI-85 calculator.  You could hack it to run assembly code and make interesting distractions from math class.  Later, I got in to web development and created a few web properties as a way to tinker around with the ideas bouncing around in my head.  When the dotcom bubble burst, and profitability was harder to come by I went back to college, graduated, and moved on to working for Microsoft and then Google.Despite being very smart, I am very dumb.  This is why Yabbly is very useful to me.Outside of typing, a few years back I got involved in performing improvised comedy around Seattle.  I've done a handful of shows aroundtown in Seattle, which is host to a vibrant community around the art.

Karen Wolfe (photographer at KarenWolfe.com) was kind enough to share with me her pov on Ross!  Here is her email to me: Ross Lake is a beautiful peaceful place to spend time.  If you are into a little adventure this is the place to visit for sure.  The adventure is mainly in how you get there.  First you are picked up at the Diablo Dam area by boat, then there is a ride on the back of a flat bed truck which then ends with another small boat ride to the resort, right to the front door of your cabin.  There is no store at the resort so you have to pack in all your  own food supplies and gear for your stay.  They are all too happy with helping you transfer your loads throughout the travel to the resort.  The adventure of getting to the resort will take about an hour.  Once there it is peaceful and incredibly beautiful.  You can rent a boat to fish or explore the lake, and there are many hiking trails etc.  I found the people and the guest were quite friendly and it appears the guests come to the resort every year.  We were told, more than once, we were lucky to get a cabin because most guests book the next year?s stay on the day they leave.  I love it!"		It wasn't but I'll def add it to the roadmap.

The problem in lawns is particularly noticeable with females, in dogs they have a higher concentration of urea (uric acid in Dalmatians).  This excess of nitrogen causes the burnout area and the immediately surrounding grass to be greener and taller (the part getting optimal nitrogen).  Here in the Northwest, our soils tend to be carbon rich (good for weeds) and nitrogen poor (also good for weeds).  That's why a high N fertilizer will green up and make your lawn grow and help keep weeds down without herbicides.  Look on fertilizer labels, you'll see three numbers, N-P-K.

It saves a lot of plastic that people either just end up throwing away anyways, and also saves paper bags because a lot of people refuse to pay the fee. This law is a good step towards helping the environment. We are also not the only county who is starting to enforce this type of law. Although I believe this bag ban is a good idea, it could be implemented better. For instance, instead of charging 5 more cents per bag, maybe saving 5 cents from the order or giving a discount for using a reusable bag would be better. "		Don't rush into a relationship.

I think the main question (admittedly a very basic one) is whether Wharton undergrad has its own career services office.  If all of U Penn undergrad has the same information sessions, on-campus interviews, etc., then I think he's fine since corporate recruiters tend to want smart, nice, but driven ppl.  So I guess I'd say any program's brand equity and network pull diminishes rapidly once the person gets the interview.  After that, I'd argue it's a tie breaker but not a huge deal.  I remember doing undergrad recruiting and overweighting the Harvard and MIT undergrads' at the resume review stage but after that, if a really smart guy happened to be from Wiliams, Wesleyan, Penn, or even Colby, we'd focus more on how they did in the interviews than the pedigree.

He will be at a disadvantage relative to the Wharton undergrads for many of the finance-heavy positions at hedge funds, asset managers, investment banks, etc.  He will have every opportunity to compete effectively for more corporate positions in various other industries.  He will have the meaningful negative of competing with more focused Wharton undergrads for the corporate positions, but this will likely be more than offset by the greater number of opportunities he'll see by virtue of being on that campus and having access to that recruiting process.  The key, other than the obvious need to maintain a strong academic record, will be to take as many Wharton courses as he can and to learn the language of business and recruiting so he comes across as business-minded and business-savvy despite his liberal arts degree."		"I'd think checking with people in the size company he's interested in would be worthwhile.

The grad students we had in Chem for example in Hanover were forced to re-take from sophomore level up because they couldn't get near passing the exams the undergrads had taken.

What makes Lake Chelan one of our favorite spots is Kelly's Resorts. Like Ross Lake Resorts, it seems more fitting to call it a retreat than resort. Kelly's resort has basic and charming cabins in the woods about a 10 minute drive from town. It's family owned and they are incredibly friendly. We enjoy the outdoor BBQ at Lake Chelan Winery, the view at Bensons, breakfast at Campbells, and the Sunshine Farm Market--especially during Harvest Season--hayrides, petting zoo, and pumpkin patch for kids, wine for us! Of course, the lake offers all kinds of activities, and town has little shops and a few restaurants if you're not just going for wineries. Lake Chelan is especially nice when there's an event. I'd check the calendars and see if anything' s going on. The town is always more festive then. Ross Lake is more isolated definitely offers a unique experience, but it depends what you're looking for and how old your kids are. (I think I read you were bringing kids?) It's right in the middle of mountains and kind of an adventure. You can boat around during the day, but I recommend leaving early. After 11am the current can get stronger and make coming in more difficult. Not a big deal but good to know. Ruby's arm is calmer than the main lake and a nice little day trip with waterfalls and a couple places where you can pull off for some lunch or to stretch your legs. If it rains, hiking is a better option, and there are some nice trials. I made a video on my last trip to Ross Lake here and give a little cabin tour:http://www.girlswhogetaround.com/2012/07/11/a-girls-getaway-ross-lake-resorts/I also wrote a little about it here:http://www.girlswhogetaround.com/2011/10/06/backcountry-beginnings-in-washington-3-spots-that-will-convert-the-reluctant/#more-279I hope that helps!

The reason I went through this many is due to the fact that most backlit Samsung flat screens (Plasmas and especially LCDs/LEDs) are notorious for screen uniformity issue. What happens is when you watch a movie in a dark room you'll start to notice 'clouds' (http://guide2lcdtv.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/clouding.jpg) in dark scenes (they are extremely visible especially if you increase/max out the backlight setting) that'll interfere with your watching experience. This is a widespread issue with most backlit Samsungs that have Edgelit feature and the problem came from the monitor's backlight that 'bleeds' into the screen panel. If you're lucky, some Samsung flat screens will not have this issue but this almost depends on which specific box you'll pick at the store (luck of the draw). I love what Samsung did with their technology, it's the slimmest, most light-weight beautifully-designed TV out there (way more so than a Panasonic) with sharp/crystal picture where blacks are actually blacks, but it sure was definitely exhausting to finally find a Samsung with the least clouding issue."		"@Ferd needn't be plasma, just a big flat screen for the main entertainment room."

I've been in the solar industry for	"Installing solar on your home or business is one of the best investments that you can make. I've been in the solar industry for 6 years. When I first started, the average residential install cost more than $10/watt of system capacity. Today average installed cost is half of that. Places like Seattle have been slow to adopt because of misinformation about the technology. Seattle's sun exposure is lousy compared to places like Arizona but it's very similar to Germany and Germany is the number one solar market in the world. For a good ROI, solar irradiance is one of only 3 necessary factors- (1) solar irradiance; (2) cost of electricity; and (3) government incentives. Germany scores high on the latter two which is why they have installed the most solar worldwide. The best ROI in the US isn't in California, Florida, or Arizona...it's in New Jersey for the same reasons. Furthermore, most people fail to consider the relative importance of solar irradiance itself. Yes, it's one of the three key factors that contribute to the ROI of a system but how much better is a sunny"" place than a ""cloudy"" place? California is one of the best. We get the equivalent of 5.5 peak sun hours per day. New Jersey get's the equivalent of about 4.2 peak sun hours per day. Therefore, California is only about 24% ""sunnier"" than New Jersey. Rain clouds and fog make solar panels less efficient but they still work. Come to San Francisco, and you'll see we have systems everywhere."					"But does that mean solar is a great investment for everyone..everywhere? The ROI isn't going to be as good in Seattle as in San Francisco or Los Angeles but that ROI is virtually guaranteed. You may find some derivative instrument out there that yields a higher return but a photovoltaic system is less risky than a US Treasury Bond. Yearly weather patterns are remarkably predictable.

It tries to dry things by using the concept that the stainless steel walls will lose heat fastest, causing the moisture to precipitate out and have the water collect on the walls of the interior.

My recco for kids would be to try an area at Waimanalo beach park called Sherwood Forest:  http://oceansafety.ancl.hawaii.edu/v/2.0/?i=oahu&shid=3&bch=waimanalobay .  There is a natural sand bar out in the water that provides some tide control and be a pseudo-pool wall if any trouble arises and the trees are nice shade for a picnic.Big YES to Giovanni's Shrimp truck, amazing.  While you're there you can hit up Matsumoto's Shave Ice:  http://www.matsumotoshaveice.com/ .  It's far out there and still gets a ton of tourists, but it's legit.  Ice cream + red beans (azuki) upgrades are very worth it.And I miss Zippy's.  Open 24 hours, safe, and has really good stuff.  Definitely try the chili (it's Hawaiian style, a variant on Cincinatti style chili), the Zip Pak bentos, and the saimin.  Kid friendly flavors if the family isn't super adventurous with their palette.  If you need souvenirs I'll suggest Target and Costco as alternatives to Walmart.  Target's stuff is a little on the kischy side but it's decent, but Costco has big boxes of chocolate, aloha shirts, and other specialty items at very good prices.  And you can gas up a rental car for way cheaper there too."		"If using credit card, use one that doesn't charge transaction charges for foreign exchange (recommended for hotel and meals).

There is a reef in the ocean that blocks the tides so it's poor for surfing and bodyboarding but great for lounging and casual stuff.  For Waimanalo park, stick to the southern end where Sherwoods is.  (1) the main park area on the North end has a semi-permanent camp of beach bums now so might be less fun there, and (2) the Sherwoods end is closer to the US Marine Corps base.  The Marines actively clean up the sands and park area since it's used by their base personnel, so the area is very nice."		"Fogo cups.

But, we were still happy to go back to our campsite at Colonial Creek campground.

Make the private vs public decision and run the numbers and do your research to make sure you want to commit to the expense and potential drawbacks of private schools.  For us, we decided to bet on the power of early education and the power of small classes/nice facilities/similarly minded parents as a predictor of adult success and know that it might not matter, felt it was worth the investment.  2.  We live in Seattle so for pre-school there are only a few that take 3 year olds.  We looked at Evergreen and UCDS and a few others but only applied to those two.  We also heard good things about Bertschi and Meridian.  Pre-K (4 and older) you get a lot more options but I can't speak about those since we ended up going to Evergreen (UCDS did not admit us).3.  It's a numbers game.  There are very few open spots because siblings consume most of the spots.  They also try to gender balance so that could make it harder still.  It's very common to apply for Pre-S, Pre-K, and K before getting in.  Cast a wide net.  I think you need to do the tours many many months in advance so you'll be looking at the 9/2013 enrollment class. 4.

At our previous house,  the developer cut down second-growth trees and sold the lumber to clear space for the development, then scraped off and sold the topsoil.  Once he built a house, he'd throw down a few inches of topsoil then sod the front yards, leaving the back bare for the homeowner to deal with.  The soil in back was so poor that even weeds took years to start growing there - it was near pure clay, so drainage was quite poor.We put down four inches of topsoil and sod, but due to the poor underlying drainage, that yard was never really good.  We tried putting several tons of sand on and working it in, to get the clay to drain better, but it was incremental improvement only.  I never got that yard to a good state.  I think it would have required a pretty major project to do so.Proper drainage is very big.

Our current house was built at the site of an old dairy, so while there's a lot of carbon in the soil, at least there's soil.I'd say you need to get some quotes to see how much it would cost to do various levels of preparation: 1) remove a foot of soil, add in a layer of sand with drain pipes, then a layer of soil, then seed or sod.  Probably mucho bucks2) strip off what's there, add some topsoil (try for high nitrogen / low carbon), then seed or sod.  Probably less ghastly than #1.3) do a yearly cycle of aeration, fertilize with a high-phosporus (new lawn) fertilizer to encourage root growth.  If you hit drainage problems, put down a couple of inches of sand each spring.If it were me, I'd bring in some contractors and say what would you do to this if you were going to guarantee <insert your metric for a great lawn> each year for the next 2/5/10 years?""."""		"So many variables.

I'm no currency trader, but my view would be the USD is likely to strengthen as a safe haven currency if global troubles (Eurozone, China slowing) continue and likely to weaken if a global recovery takes hold and risk tolerance rises.  I would expect a global slowdown to continue to weigh on commodity prices, which are the driver of the Aussie economy and the AUD exchange rate.  If an otherwise strengthening USD in such a scenario puts further pressure on those global commodities priced in USD, it would compound the pressure on the AUD.  So, in theory, if you think we're looking at a prolonged global slowdown, I like the long USD / short AUD position.  Alternatively, if you think we're out of the woods, I would like the opposite.  But I wouldn't be comfortable personally putting either trade on without researching where those currencies have been in the short and midterm past, to determine whether the effects I'm describing are already expressed in the exchange rate.  Furthermore, determining when to put the trade on is often easier than determining when to take it off.

Usually around 2-3 percent per year i	"Dirt that is left to build up on modules does have an impact on the output of the system.  Usually around 2-3 percent per year if left unattended.  Of course it varies.  I have seen systems in places like Palm Desert, CA that were caked brown only 3 days after being cleaned.  Of course, with all the rain in Seattle you are not likely to see any measurable drop in output.  Just make sure there are no leaves collected on the modules.  If the modules are going on a flat roof rather than a pitched roof you will want to tilt them at least 10 degrees.  This tilt is more important to allow for run-off then it is for increasing the efficiency of the modules.As for sizing, the average PV module today is rated at about 240 watts.  So for a 10kW system you would need to install 42 of them.  These measure about 66 high x 40"" wide.  So you need a sizable piece of roof.  I don't ever think in square footage terms because roofs are remarkable different shapes and only ""usable"" roof space matters.  This is roof space that faces either south, west, or east and has no obstructions (chimneys, vent pipes, skylights, etc).  Before you go assuming you need a 10kW you need to look at your consumption.  Unless you have a plug in vehicle (or intend to purchase one) there is no point in oversizing the system because you don't get paid for excess production.  In a net metering situation your excess production rolls over from one month to be used the next.  But if you havent' used it by December 31st- it's gone.  Look at your last 12 months of electric bills.  Your monthly consumption is measured in Kilowatt Hours (kWh).  Add that number for the past 12 months and divide it by 365 days.  This will determine your average daily consumption.  If you post it I will show you how to calculate what size system you need.  This way the other Yabblers can read it too."""		Ferd that was Phil.

This is one of the reasons I chose it because some of them are just too bulky.  It comes with a separate velcro band if you are more in to that type (I am).  It is water resistant but I don't wear it while I swim.  This is the exact one:  http://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-405CX-Sport-Monitor/dp/B0025UHKNS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1344840980&sr=8-1&keywords=garmin+forerunner+405cx.  I bought it with the heart rate monitor which I use in training almost every day.  What's great about the Garmin watches is they give you all the data you could possibly want and are relatively easy to use.  With this one the main screen gives you Overall Time, Distance traveled, and real time Pace for that interval (which I set to 1 mile but it's adjustable).  With one touch you go to a different screen that gives you your current heart rate.  They all come with a little chip that's like a mini flash drive.  You plug it into your computer and leave it there.  When you get back from your workout, the watch senses the little chip and wirelessly downloads the workout to your page.  This is an example a recent bike ride I went on: http://connect.garmin.com/activity/196829908.  These workouts save to your page and can be shared via social media.  The one drawback to this and other Garmin watches is the battery life.  I do long distance triathlons and this battery never lasts more than 7 hours.  If most of your workouts are shorter than that this is the watch for you. If you are doing several a day or workouts/races that go longer than 7 hours that battery life becomes an issue.  I use the watch for both running and cycling.  I hope this helps."		Hi Phil - average daily consumption is 98.6 KWH/days.   Obviously higher consumption in hot months.  Thanks in advance!	Hi Phil - average daily consumption is 98.6 KWH/days.

Mistake #1 was that my idea was in no way original and many others were already there. Mistake #2 was that all the pay lots were full (not as many in the ID) because it was so close to game time. So we ended up doing street metered parking but it was still a close walk so it ended up being 40 minutes door-to-door. Big problem was that street parking has a 2-hour limit, so we had to leave the game early. I think Wes had the right idea, should have just targeted parking close to the stadium and paid the fee. Lesson learned, listen to the yabblers.Side note: A few minutes after I get home, my Android phone dings - It's Google Cards (new feature in Jelly Bean), telling me the Sounders won 2-0. I had done a maps search earlier that day, and of course my phone was at the stadium during daytime. So Google used one or both of those signals and determined I would be interested in the outcome of the game. Which was of course both awesome and creepy.Thanks for the tips everybody!"		I would recommend against the big island.

One is Discover Escape (http://www.dailymarkets.com/creditcards/escape-by-discover-review/) and the other is Amazon. Amazon is great just like Tom described but I do find Discover to be much more flexible in terms of their rewards (miles) and card usage.  You earn 2 miles for every $1 you spend on everyday purchases, and these points can be redeemed toward any airline ticket, hotels, or travel-related expenses. These are extremely easy to redeem and it's done through their website.There's also no foreign transaction fee on the card since it's Discover (unlike Visa and Mastercard) so you can use it in countries like Canada without incurring 3% of the transaction cost (great if you travel a lot). Furthermore, the miles can also be used to purchase from Amazon.com (100 miles = $1) like the Amazon points. Last but not least, Discover tends to be generous and very lenient when it comes to bumping your credit limit, much more so than Amazon.The only two downsides to Discover is first, there is a $60 annual fee attached to it, but I find their miles to completely compensate for this fee since you do earn it the miles rapidly if you keep using the card. Second, I find that businesses do not accept Discover as widely as they do with Visa and Mastercard- so if you eat out a lot this may not be such a great idea if this will be your first and only card. I do use it as my primary card and I use Amazon for places that don't accept Discover."		Dude from Wisconsin	Dude from Wisconsin		Triple X in Issaquah.

I've never had the pizza there, I always get one of the pasta dishes, like spaghetti and meatballs. Great for kids and the whole family -- in fact it's a great place if you have a large party of 8 or 10 people. They give the kids pizza dough and flour to play with while you wait for your food. Love the salads there - comes with chickpeas and olives and other stuff in addition to the usual lettuce, tomato etc. Spaghetti is great. Chianti bottles hung from the ceiling, super low key and friendly. Go to the one in Pacific Beach though -- I don't think the other locations are as good. Perfect for dinner after a day at the beach. If definitely want pizza though, try Hoboken Pizza (also on Garnet I think) up about 10 more blocks away from the beach.

A lot of the mirrorless compacts such as the Fuji suggested above works well also -- with interchangeable lenses.If size is not an issue, I would go with a traditional DSLR (all pros use these for serious shots).  Canon 5D Mark III ($3500) is great, so is the Nikon D800E ($3200) -- both are full frames.  At sub-1000 range, Canon t4i / t3i are great.

We saw all kinds of wildlife, including an up close and personal encounter with a lion.  We were walking single file, I was second in line behind the lead guide, and the lion, a young adult, crossed our path, about 10 feet away from me.  It was pretty amazing!Anyway, I strongly recommend going to Kruger, and South Africa in general.  While Cape Town is one of my favorite cities in the world, Johannesburg is an unredeeming place that I would avoid unless you like shopping malls and the feel of an armed camp (the movie District Nine"" captures this very well)."""		"I like the American Express Optima card.

No annual fee, automatic cash rebate 1-2% (depends on type of spending, but no hassle, no process to redeem any points) and Amex's customer service is top notch.  If you pay with amex and don't get the service/goods you were promised after making a reasonable attempt to resolve with the vendor, you dispute the charges thru Amex and they will suspend the charges until they investigate and correspond with the vendor on your behalf.  Some other nice free perks like if your purchase is stolen or lost within 60 days or so, amex will replace.  Downside is they impose the 2 or 3% transaction charge on international charges that involve foreign currency conversions."		"I asked a friend, and he suggested moleskin."

If you redeem the thank you points for Giftcards... each point is worth a penny. If you use the Thank you points for anything else it ends up being $.0063 per point... Interestingly enough if you do alot of Amazon purchasing... the Citi Forward card is a better deal than the Amazon card. The Forward card counts Amazon as a book store and you end up getting 5 points per dollar spent at amazon.. and as long as you redeem those points for Gift cards... you end up getting %5... You also get 5% at restaurants... which for me when I was younger was pretty awesome.If you're going for your first card I would get the VISA purely on the fact that it's accepted in many more places than your Discover... I used to have an AMEX and often had to pull out my VISA to make purchases because the AMEX wasn't accepted everywhere.

I mostly got it because it's one of the few Visa/MC that have 0% foreign transaction fees (saved me nearly $100 when I went to australia).I also have a chase freedom which nets me about 1.5% based on their bonuses which change quarterly.One thing to watch out for is tiered rewards -- this is common on Discover and Amex (though the ones above do not appear to be tiered).  For example, a typical discover card you only earn 1% after spending $5000; prior to that you earn .25%.  This can have a significant affect on your overall cashback rate if you aren't a high spender.(Also fyi, the optima card is no longer being offered to new members)"		"Thanks, everyone!

The amount of diversification achieved through these low costs in	"Index and mutual fund investing are definitely the way to go.  The amount of diversification achieved through these low costs investments along with the investors ability to incorporate many broad asset classes make these investments the most logical choice.  I would argue there are advantages to the use of low cost mutual funds form passively managed fund companies like iShares and Dimensional Funds (DFA) over strictly index funds.  One example of the benefit of using a mutual fund comes up in the reconstitution of the indexes.  Each year a group of companies that comprised the S&P 500 Index Fund for example, will fall under the market cap to be included in the index and a group of companies will be added.  The index fund by a function of their investment policy statement will be forced to sell a number of companies from the index and/or buy a number of companies strictly because they need to maintain the index allocation.  Companies falling out of the index generally will have price declines and the companies coming into the index will have price appreciation.  So what has happened is the index fund company will sell at a discount companies in their index that are not a part of the S&P 500 and pay at a premium the companies they need to purchase for the index.  This reconstitution represents a cost that is not printed as part of the operating expense ratio but is manifested in lower returns.  DFA on the other hand will allow for benchmark error and as a result does not pay these costs simply because of the need to reconstitute the fund.  As I said this is one such example of some of the benefits of a mutual fund over index funds.  The most realistic allocation likely comprises a mix of mutual funds, ETFs and ETNs.  For example I use Vanguard ETFs for the Emerging Markets and International asset classes but use the DFA Funds for most of the US positions."		"You bring up an interesting point Katie:While some of the more obvious costs of an investment strategy may consist of a fund"	"You bring up an interesting point Katie:While some of the more obvious costs of an investment strategy may consist of a funds operating expense ratio and the fees charged by an advisor (readily published and available) there are less obvious costs as well.  Many of these less obvious costs fall outside of the investment vehicles and are paid out of total wealth.These costs might include: lack of appropriate diversification (not globally diversifying), tax inefficiency, lack of monitoring (not rebalancing the portfolio), opportunity costs, emotional errors (selling to cash when the market has bottomed), and not correctly placing assets.  For example with asset placement, many investors believe that they should place stocks that are likely to appreciate rapidly inside of a tax advantaged account rather than the bond portion of their portfolio.  In fact, it is generally advantageous to place bonds in your tax advantaged accounts because the coupon and interest payments are paid at regular income tax rates vs. stock appreciation at long-term rates (assumes care in not realizing ST gains)  In a taxable brokerage account, you can sell out a loss position and swap in a nearly identical fund to harvest"" the loss while not having been out of the market in that asset class."					"Unfortunately many times the people who would most greatly benefit from working directly with an advisor do not do so until later stages in life, for example, just prior to retirement.

There are tons of good independent (and public!) schools, but those parameters could really help narrow it down.  The application process at independent schools can vary from fairly mellow and with decent odds (especially at smaller schools), to fairly involved and with generally low odds (at schools like UCDS).  Also, when evaluating schools, try to talk to some of the parents of kids who already go there -- I think this can be very helpful to get an overall sense of the attitudes and perspectives in that school's community (and to us, it seemed like each school was different).  Also, regarding class sizes -- I don't think the difference in teacher-to-student ratios between public and independent schools is *necessarily* as huge as it would at first appear (though obviously, in general, there is a difference).  At the local public school that I toured, they appeared to be very resourceful at getting a second adult into many of their classrooms -- teaching aides, parent volunteers, special ed. aides, etc.  Good luck!"		"Previous poster here -- if you are looking for *preschools,* one issue to consider is the long waitlists.

I can't compare to private, but I had a decent experience and here are a few things I think contributed to that:1) Advanced classes - in Elementary school there was the accelerated class (called GATE - Gifted and Talented Education - at the time) and that was good. Don't know status of those programs these days but in my day there was just one school per district that offered it, so many classmates traveled. In high schools there's of course advanced placement.2) School flexibility - Not something public schools are known for so maybe I lucked out. But they let me take math classes above my grade level, let me test out of filler classes like home economics, and eventually let me skip out of school early to take classes at the local college. I would have been incredibly bored without this.3) Diversity - I went to school with immigrants, gang bangers, poor kids, kids from dysfunctional families. This was by far a more positive than negative experience (notwithstanding the occasional school stabbing!) and is my biggest worry about sending my kid to private school (that she only interacts with rich white kids).Hope that's some food for thought on what you might look for in your schools!"		I can tell you from experience you don't mess with back pain. Don't try to push through it or you could end up on your back unab	"I can tell you from experience you don't mess with back pain. Don't try to push through it or you could end up on your back unable to get up for days at a time. If you think it'll heal on it's own, try walking or doing intervals (run for 1 minute, walk for 1 minute) just to the point where the pain is being caused. Consider that the source of the pain is your posture - I had this problem jogging and a physical therapist helped me. The therapist mostly helped me understand my body, how to have good posture, and how to stretch. Stretching is important. I went to Olympic Physical Therapy (http://www.olympicpt.com/therapists_bio.asp?pg=2&pdx=163&zdx=3) and Elizabeth fixed me up but it was also a lot more expensive than I expected (about ~$200/hour, partially covered by insurance)."		"Yes very true, I mentioned: for a taxable brokerage account, to illustrate some other costs"" investors pay that aren't simply o"""	"Yes very true, I mentioned: for a taxable brokerage account, to illustrate some other costs"" investors pay that aren't simply operating expense ratios or management fees.  In this case you are completely correct tax loss harvesting would not be beneficial in the 401k question for the original thread.  Your point that past performance does not predict the future certainly proves to be true.  There has been some interesting research over the years regarding the success of Morningstar ratings in predicting the performance of funds.  Here is one article that discusses the ratings: "					http://articles.marketwatch.com/2010-05-28/investing/30741585_1_mutual-funds-star-rating-star-ratings						"Of the 248 stock funds with five-star ratings at the start of the period, just four still kept that rank after 10 years. The 218 domestic stock funds with the rating typically lagged their category averages over the period -- not just the benchmarks, but other mutual funds. The exceptions were 30 foreign large-cap funds, which had a 10-year annualized return of 1.44% compared with their category average of 1.32%.In other words, it's not just that five-star funds don't, on average, continue to lead their peers, but they actually do worse in subsequent years.The worst performers were small-cap growth funds. The category's 29 five-star funds in 1999 lost an average of 3.6% annualized over the next decade. The category overall was up 0.6% in the period.""Great convo here!

The one's I'm familiar with are sold in large blocks (~20 or 30 years) at what seems to be a good price.  However if you do the math on the time value of money over that period of time, it doesn't look so great.  Add to that the (sometimes hidden) fees each time you book and the risk that you won't actually use all of your slots (who really knows what their vacation preferences and needs will be 20 years from now?) and it starts to look even worse.  The ones I've seen also have large commissions for a captive broker if you decide to sell prior to expiration.   In my experience, the only positives to getting a timeshare are 1) if you get the kind that give you access to multiple locations you may have some convenience value or 2) if you get a really good financial deal, which usually means a resort that did not initially intend to do timeshares but was unable to sell all of its condomiums and opted to do timeshares from a position of weakness.  The question then becomes why it couldn't sell all of its condo inventory and whether there's something flawed about the resort."		Agree with Mark.

The key thing is if/when that happens, are you in the middle of a desert or are you in a employer rich environment that's within a community that you and your family would love.This is advice I wished I had gotten when I last moved.  I focused almost entirely on the company and offer and didn't realize I was really accepting an offer from (and making a commitment to) the city.

If you read any car mags, this is the gold standard for sports sedans.  Here's the thing.  I test drove it and honestly, it just didn't have the grunt I was expecting.  Don't get me wrong, it was super smooth and solid, it just didn't feel as tossable as my MINI turbo.  There's also an issue IMO opinion with the BMW 3 series in general and that is it's becoming a very popular choice of females.  So if you're a female or male who doesn't care about driving a female's car, this is not an issue but for me, I wanted something that was a bit more masculine.2.  Audi S4.  A bit more grunt than the 335 Xdrive, great engine, it's like a velvet hammer.  Like the 3 series, the S4 is a bit bigger than I'd like which I find makes it less zippy and tossable in in-city driving.  I think I like the lines of the 335 better than the S4 (esp with the M sports package) but you might find the interior and less cookie cutter S4 to be more up your alley.3.  Mitsubishi Evolution MR.  This has no right to be compared to the first two from a high brow heritage pov but I did anyway (and ended up buying one).  The main thing about the Evo MR is it's kind of stealth power.  It goes to 60 in under 5 seconds, has AWD with yaw control, and basically eats corners up for lunch.  It however is not nearly as nice inside as the Audi or as gorgeous as the Bimmer.  You can also get an evo fully loaded for low 40s which would be prob about 10K less than the 335 or S4 fully loaded.  4.  Cadillac ATS.  This was not available when I was buying but has gotten rave reviews coming in at comparable performance to the first 2.  I kind of like it because you don't see as many people driving these as you will the 3 series and Audis.  5.  MB C300 4Matic.  Less common than BMW's but perhaps not as agile.6.  Subaru STI.  Like Evo but a bit more boy racer and no auto (I commute in stop n go so wanted a daily driver with dual clutch auto)."		"I would echo the rec for the Audi S4.

The Audi AWS is as good as any I've seen, the car handles beautifully and of course the engine is very punchy.  I owned an older model, but the 2013 is getting good reviews.  Another option would be the Infiniti G37x.  Almost as fun to drive as the Audi, although it doesn't have quite the same rock-solid handling and the fit and finish are also of lower quality -- however, on the plus side it's ~$10k cheaper."		"I started watching them with our son at 4.

I bought a Star Wars story book and sticker book for my son when he was 4.  That way I could introduce the characters and concept, but I could control the plot line.  He was excited about the robots and ships and lightsabers.  He understood that the mean looking guys were the bad guys.  But I didn't have to worry about anything being overly scary or having to explain mature stuff like (spoiler alert) Darth Vader being Luke's father.  He was so into it that we later got him Star Wars sheets and a comforter for his bed.  And he still hasn't seen any of the movies (he's 5 now), but he doesn't even know they exist.  I think this will also make him less likely to be scared when I do show him the movies, because he already knows a bunch of the characters and will expect to see a bunch of the bad guys."		"If you do NOT want to have constant light saber fights in your living room, do NOT let kids watch StarWars.

Part of the reason that nothing stuck is that I'm not in the market for a tablet. We have an iPad 2 and it is totally sufficient for the basic things we need (web browsing, netflix, very occasionally Amazon streaming) and is showing no signs of obsolescence (retina and their ilk are a nice try but really if I'm watching a move on a tiny screen the viewing experience is obviously not of primary importance). If I was in the market I would definitely include it in my consideration set but would be wary of locking myself into buying all media from Amazon especially since that is basically Amazon's explicitly stated strategy. Paying to remove ads is in bad taste, seems obvious to me that a discount to accept ads (as was done with some previous kindles) would have been much smarter (yes I know this is the same thing!), but it seems like that was a reactive decision to consumer outcry."		"Yep, browser (Chrome) caching issue.

It should be more about the fundamentals of the company. My stint at Google imprinted on me that the market is often not aligned with fundamentals. I was there for four years and the Google stock went from 600 down to 300 back to 600 and then down to 300 again when I was leaving and now it is is back above 600. It is hard to believe the fundamentals of Google changed so dramatically, so many times, in a relatively short period of time. I think technology stocks, especially new ones, are more cyclical because the underlying financial models are so dependent on high growth - a small change in those assumptions can have a huge impact on the stock. It seems, at least to some degree, FB stock has been battered and it is possible that the next bit of good news could send them surging again.

Holders earn points for free nights in Starwood - we have found that 9000 points (typically valued at $90 cash back) gets us a $200-$300 room.   We use it as a supplemental card and we love how it changes the economics of a weekend getaway to a big city or a longer vacation.   We stayed at some fab places in Hawaii and downtown Chicago.

I use the miles as reward points on Amazon.com in addition to redeeming any travel-related purchases with them (airfare, hotels, etc). Also it's 2 miles toward $1 on any purchase, and if you buy from Discover.com shopping mall then it's 3 miles for $1. The only potential downside to this card is the annual $60 fee, but it pays off for itself every year (especially if you travel once or twice per year) if you use it as your primary card."		Also - speaking of the customer support for Discover.

I spoke with them last year to increase my credit limit and they've done it in under 10 minutes flat with no hassle.

In my experience, the child needs to have one reference person who speaks ""only English"" and others who speak (in our case) ""only German"" with him/her, so there is consistency. Bilingual public education has been a big failure here in Texas, with the result that students sometimes speak and write  both languages poorly. Our son was 9 months old when my job was transferred to Germany and 4 years old when we returned. He has a Spanish-speaking nanny for 8 months in Houston. Then he had a German-speaking nanny and went to a British nursery school twice a week for 2 years. We relied on the excellent German Saturday School here in Houston after we ""repatriated"" from Germany and many of our Houston neighbors sent their kids to the Chinese Saturday School. Both schools were very accommodating when sports and music lessons conflicted. So all the kids in our neighborhood got the message that a second language was part of your heritage and part of who you are as an American. Even though it's a hassle to read that good night story in a foreign language, it will pay big dividends later on when the kids are more empathetic and more thoughtful because they do have experience in another language."""		I think invite only makes sense when you want to tightly control who accesses your functionality.

I don't think it's rude for one-of-a-kind 5-star restaurant to refuse any requests that will change the essence or the spirit of the dish that they are trying to serve to the customer. When you dine at restaurants of this caliber, remember that food itself is the soul of the overall dining experience that defines the place that you dine at (changing their food is the same as getting food from another restaurant), and for that reason, you're also required to invest a certain amount of faith in the skills of the chefs and trust that they will do everything they can to prepare the most delicious meal for you, even if this meal may lack or include certain ingredients that you may or may not be accustomed to. Now for chain restaurants, due to the more 'scaled' nature of the meal production, I believe they should be a lot more flexible and willing to accommodate your request to change certain ingredients.That said, I also believe every restaurant should have a secret menu item that only regular customers know about and can customize to their liking."		"@Tom, no opinion on beef or fish...

At the end of the day, look at the net amount spent on housing after taking into account mortgage, rental income, and rent and see if it is within your budget. And, as your sense tells you, in certain markets it can be cheaper to rent than to own. It is particular true in hotter markets like Seattle or SF and especially true if you are considering a shorter time period since transaction costs for ownership are so high. Zillow has a few nice articles about price-to-rent ratios that are worth reading.But, you also have a choice as to whether you 1) rent out your house or 2) sell your house and invest the equity into other assets (and your landlording time into other pursuits). The price to rent ratios also are helpful in this decision. In my case, Ann Arbor home prices are so low that I can do much better financially by renting out my house then selling it, even after taking into account the home expenses, landlord time, and extra taxes (check if your area has different property taxes for investment properties). It can be seductive to convince yourself that just because you can cover your mortgage with rental income that it is a good deal to rent out your house. The seduction deepens if you happen to love your house (in which case - all bets are off - keep the house). But, if you are concerned about the financial end, I would do the math and compare where you would be in five years if you rent out the house versus selling it and investing the proceeds in a mutual fund that gets 5% per year.

What's a more likely scenario?  1) Steal your phone; mount it on their computer; read the data on it; figure out where you live; take it back to your house; wait for you to leave; break in?2) Just break in.If you have something in your house that is awesome and worth stealing someone will get in and steal it if they want.  If someone doesn't know whether or not you have something awesome in your house worth stealing they may break in anyway and steal it.  Thieves don't go through your door anyway unless it's unlocked.  They'll crawl in through pet doors, go in through windows, etc. So really the question is--is it more convenient for you than a key?  If so, go for it, and put a passcode on your phone.  My house was robbed and they didn't go in through a locked door.  My friend's house was robbed twice--neither time through a locked door and the second time they had a security system...didn't matter.Pretty sure most neighborhood thieves aren't going to go through all that trouble.  6 houses were hit on my block in one night.  Not a single window was broken, no doors kicked in...if your house is reasonably secured there's likely one just down the street that's not.That being said, I bought a home security cam system from Costo for under $300...4 cameras, records to DVR, motion-activated if you want it, night vision....and you can check in on your house from your phone or the web at any time.  From discussions with officers, that's actually the best deterrent right now, because a video can potentially prove that someone is in your house even if you don't catch them, and that can make something into a felony instead of a misdemeanor.  That is automatically a bigger problem and something that most home burglars won't take a chance on."		I was in a similar situation and everybody told me that Verizon was vastly superior but I decided to stick with AT&T and it's ac	I was in a similar situation and everybody told me that Verizon was vastly superior but I decided to stick with AT&T and it's actually been fine so far.

IWC has a good number of sporty options. some might be even under the rolex prices. check out the acquatimer collection. Panerai is a big watch, so if you like big, you might prefer to go with one of these. this is my favorite italian watch. most of their watches come already with a leather and a rubber band. the steel bands are also available in most models. they have a good number of models and can be more easily found today. i got mine about 7 years ago and had to look far to find it here in the US."		"Wait a week.

We've stayed in South Kihei both times and rented condos but explored different areas of the island. We like having a kitchen so we can prepare snacks and drinks, plus having the extra room is nice to kick back.  Of course, we are also into 'getting deals' and this seemed like the way to go.  If we wanted to 'do it up' and not be concerned about price or having our own kitchen, I recommend The Four Seasons.  The beach is the nicest, the restaurant options are the best and it is close to other amenities in Kihei (5 minute drive north).  If you don't have a desire to be near amenities then I think your best bet is Kaanapali Beach, where there are numerous hotels and excellent beaches. The nearest area with amenities from hear is due south to lahaina. Short drive, about 15 minutes or so."		Are you looking to replace the stereo or do you want a wireless solution using what you already have or?

The system will play for a couple hours without needing to be plugged in. I can adjust the songs and volume with my iphone wirelessly.  The sound is surprisingly exceptional considering the size of the speakers it is coming from.  It really fills in a room.2) The other set up I have is an AppleTV connected to my home receiver.   You need to have a wireless network in your house, the receiver must have an optical jack.  AppleTV connects to receiver.  (My receiver is nearly 10 years old and has an optical jack). I set my receiver volume on fairly high. Then play all my tunes on my iphone, which wirelessly pushes to appleTV, which pushes it to the receiver. I can then control everything from my iphone from anywhere in my house wirelessly. Works great and is super easy once it is set up."		Have you checked out Bell & Ross watches?

With a 200mm lens, frame your shot to include Alcatraz in the upper background, but focus on the center of the intersection.   Wait...   Eventually you'll hear the cable car coming up Hyde St. (it runs about every 10-15 minutes). It's not visible until the last few seconds - so be ready. As soon as it crests into the intersection fire away. I recommend at least 1/500 of a second to stop the action.

The fact you can pan and zoom remotely is pretty awesome so you can cover the entire room with one strategically placed camera.  Lastly, we like the two-way microphone feature where u can tell them to knock it off without going into the room or ask them questions.

Double the cost of anything I've used previously, and while the initial comfort was great it very quickly degraded -- there are significant impressions in the pillow top where we sleep (my wife and I are average-sized folks) that make it much less comfortable to lie on now.  The 10 year S&F warranty is a sham here; the fine print says that impressions in the top up to 1.5-2 inches deep are totally within spec as little as 6 months into the life of the mattress.

It gauges your active movement (awake), or lack of movement (sleep, and if for longer than a certain period of time, REM sleep), based on that.  Less movement for longer equals better sleep, more movement / twitches / etc. means you were active.  The chart for sleeping looks similar to the chart for activity, flat for when you got pretty good sleep (little movement) and active spikes for when you moved (rolling over counts as movement).

They also make various types so if you do a lot of water sports you can get a pair you can wear in the water and on land, if you hike a lot you can get ones that have more tread for hiking, etc.  They also afford you a lot better traction and maneuverability because you can use your toes to your advantage -- great for hiking, running up or down hills, and running on uneven surfaces.  They're worth a try."		"I second Craig's List -- and specifically, if you can, look for an industrial one that can do up to a 10% incline (the most expe"	"I second Craig's List -- and specifically, if you can, look for an industrial one that can do up to a 10% incline (the most expensive industrial made for gyms will only go up to 15%).  You'll only ever want to go up to 8% because beyond that you cause knee damage (from 2%-5% you actually relieve pressure from the knees somewhat and force it to the ankles, but from 6%-8% you add a large degree of pressure to the knees so extended periods at that steep of an incline is not good for your knees).  Good treadmills that can do that type of incline (15%) usually run around $2,500 since they're made for gyms.  I found mine (NordicTrack EXP 1000, which does a 1-10% incline, 1 mph - 10 mph) on CL for $250.  It is heavy -- I cannot emphasize that enough.  One person cannot carry this unless they are a body builder.  I was able to move it in pieces alone, but once it's together (this kind folds up for easier storage), it's huge, bulky, and you'll need two people to move it.  I believe it weighs around 350 lbs so keep that in mind if you have stairs you have to move it up/down.However, it is a great machine, even though it's around 10 years old.  So keep your eye out for something similar (though more recent), with a good track record for not breaking down (research online).With treadmills you really do get what you pay for, the parts are very very expensive so put out the extra cash at the start and save yourself in the long run."		sonia agree bing lack of alerts is lame.  this is what happens when great startups get acquired :-(	sonia agree bing lack of alerts is lame.  this is what happens when great startups get acquired :-(		"Learn jQuery first, add Ajax -- that gives you the foundation for Sencha, then add in Objective-C for iDevice app development, a"	"Learn jQuery first, add Ajax -- that gives you the foundation for Sencha, then add in Objective-C for iDevice app development, and finally add in Flash (yeah, yeah, I know - but trust me on this).

DON'T GUESS!Women tend to talk about these things with people they're close to and those they're close to will want their family member / friend to be happy and excited and they'll love that they had a part in her happiness.  Women also tend to drop hints constantly about what they want, but they can be cryptic.In which case you may want to consider giving your wife a pass for one day - one day where you will do anything with her, for her, go anywhere with her, eat at any restaurant, you are hers for the entire day.  If she asks for a massage, you do it.  If she wants to be alone to read, you're out of sight.  If she wants you to fix that damn window, you do it.  Anything she wants.  The trick to this is to either (a) tell her a week before hand to come up with a list so she has time to figure out the gist of what she wants to do so you can plan it all -- thereby guaranteeing that she gets to do exactly what she wants or (b) present it to her on the day of and she gets to come up with it all spontaneously.  You can also make it so she can use that voucher"" on another day.  Present it to her with a card (handmade if possible, even if it's messy, she'll think it's thoughtful) and a little bell and tell her just to ""ring"" you whenever she wants you (this is the cute feature)."					"If she chooses not to use it that day, plan to do something for her -- dinner out is easy and you can do that any night, but what about inviting her closest friends over (that she enjoys spending time with) and cooking them all dinner, or hiring a private chef to do so (not as expensive as you'd think, check with local cooking schools)."						"While it's nice to plan a spa day, dinner out, etc. if she's not feeling it that day then you've just made her feel obligated to do it all.  Maybe she doesn't like people touching her feet or massaging her.  Unless you know she enjoys those things, it's a big risk."""			"I've created custom Wordpress sites using the Project Manager, Table Reloaded, and Events Manager plugins for teams (among other"	"I've created custom Wordpress sites using the Project Manager, Table Reloaded, and Events Manager plugins for teams (among other plugins).

But without knowing that information here are three factors to consider:1) Mac vs Windows Cost: Macs keep their value, Windows machines don't.  Expect to buy a new Windows machine every couple of years which will equal the cost of one Mac.  In addition, a Mac can be resold for almost full value, Windows machines can be donated to someone.2) Mac vs Windows Functionality: they'll both do anything you want, except gaming and iOS development (for the most part).  Windows machines are better for gaming because they're cheaper to upgrade to get enough memory, etc.  You need a Mac to do iOS native development.  Macs will play games though, just more expensive to upgrade -- especially when it comes to the laptops.3) Mac vs Windows Flexibility: a Windows machine will only run Windows.  You can dual boot to another OS (Linux) if you want but you can't dual boot to Mac.  A Mac on the other hand gives you three machines in one,  Mac, Windows (using Parallels), and Linux if you want it.  So you get much more OS flexibility with a Mac than a Windows machine.With those things in mind that should help a bit.  I have several Windows machines (HP and Dell) and several Macs (desktop and laptop) -- I even have a Mac from 1998 that still works and gets use regularly whereas the Windows laptop from the same time is a brick.If you go with a Mac, look at refurbished ones from Apple or from Craig's List.  They are workhorse machines and you can get a good as new"" used, whereas Windows machines are best bought new."""		yabb.ly/18wfXq - I have these and love them.

Some jackets can be overly or under technical.  Marmot seems to have found a nice mix.  Good for an around the town jacket that can double as a ski/snowboard jacket but doesn't need to get you up Rainer. There is a Marmot store in Bellevue on NE 8th and Bellevue way or REI is always a great choice too.

Wordpress is not maintenance free, plugins need to be updated often weekly, the foundation program needs to be updated monthly usually, and the site should be monitored constantly.You need to keep it updated, backed up, and need to know how themes affect functionality and what functionality you need.  You also need to know how to speed it up for your visitors, which plugins will do what you need (like contact forms), how to create special areas if you need them, how to incorporate ecommerce if you need it, etc.It may be worth consulting with a developer to get their insight.  Paying someone $1,500 / year for maintenance (for them to backup and maintain your site's back end so it doesn't get hacked) and $2,500-$5,000 for development of a secure, custom, and monitored site can be worth it.  Once your site is hacked it's hard to restore it properly.If you have a business, any web design / development is a business write off as a normal business expense, keep that in mind.  And if you pay for cheap when you first do it you'll pay again in six months or a year.  Your website represents your business ... if you pay for cheap or free that's how you'll look.I've been doing media work for 15 years and my clients range from individuals to Fortune 50 companies.  I offer all my clients the ability to spread their payments over 12 months so they can afford a safe, secure, easy to manage, and reputable site that represents them accurately to their customers.  Most companies won't offer that, they just want to get your money and run.  Find someone who wants your business to succeed and will recommend things accordingly -- not just stuff to get more money."		I have a fitbit and really like it overall.

The difference is in the amount of storage the boxes have -- the 4GB is enough for save files for games, but I'd really recommend springing for the 250GB. There are a lot of free demos and quality downloadable games on XBLA that will quickly eat up the 4GB of space. There are expansion hard drives you can buy but they are expensive ($120 retail for a 250GB drive) and stick out of the USB slots on the XBOX like a sore thumb.4GB is $199 base, and the $250GB is $299 base price. There are a TON of bundles available that will save you a few bucks compared to buying all the parts separately. The savings are usually pretty even between the bundles, so my recommendation would be to take a look at them online and in-stores and see which ones fit your family's needs the best. If you're set on getting the Kinect for dancing games, for example, the Kinect bundle will do you better than getting the one with shooter games that may be inappropriate age-wise for your son.The 360 is a great platform for Netflix streaming. If you're going to do a lot of watching-only activities you should consider picking up the TV remote: yabb.ly/33iZTR. It's nice to have TV power, XBOX controls, and volume all wrapped up into one device so you don't have to power on and off the controllers.Accessories for the XBOX are a bit pricier than the Wii but I think you'll get a lot of value from the system.  Also the video quality is passable if you have an older TV, but the improvement is very noticeable if you use the HDMI connection with a digital/HD capable television."		"Whoops the link for the remote got broken when I copied and pasted, here it is again:  http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-360-Media-Remo"	"Whoops the link for the remote got broken when I copied and pasted, here it is again:  http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-360-Media-Remote/dp/B005FMLZQQ/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1351794056&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=xbox+remote"		I agree with Shan.

The mattresses do sleep warm, but I've gotten used to it. Plus, that extra heat comes in handy during the winter and on otherwise cold nights."						2. Memory foam mattresses aren't typically flippable but I rotate mine 2-3 times a year and that has helped immensely.						"3.

But you also said you want to have all the apps that you've already invested in from iOS.  Honestly a pretty good option to consider is an iPad 2 or a refurb as they're on the cheaper end and you can still get warranty protection on them.  If you want the latest and greatest screen and speed then the newest iPad revision is pretty awesome.  I think with the Surface you're betting on MS getting it right in a big way and having everything play nicely as they advertise.  But Microsoft has a history of putting out platforms and building marketplaces only to abandon them completely.

Otherwise you have the AMC Pacific Place theaters, and the Meridian.  The permanent cop in the lobby at the Meridian kind of weirds me out, and I prefer the facilities and parking at Pacific Place so I prefer there if I have a choice.The theaters in the UD, like Ian mentions, were always a little on the sketch/run-down side for me.

My kid loves it, but probably not for everyone.My philosophy with my kids and sports (or really any activity, musical instrument, etc) is that the better they are at it, the more they'll enjoy it. So, we try to find things they like and then push them a little bit to work hard at it and get better. I figure if you're going to do a thing, do it well or do something else.Coerver is definitely for kids who want to work hard to get significantly better at soccer.

What the industry calls Qualified, Mid Qualified and Non-Qualified.  So depending if the card is debit or a rewards card or a corporate card you will be charged a different rate and transaction charge. That's just how the system works. Make sure you know the pricing for each tier of pricing.On top of that, there are also end of day batch charges, monthly minimums, annual fees and cancellation charges.  If you need to use cc's on your shopping cart, that can be an additional monthly charge and transaction fee.What I have seen is that banks take advantage of their relationships and usually have worse rates than online merchant banks.The easy answer is if you plan on charging over $10k a month, shop around.

I had the opportunity to test one this past weekend and the controller is very cool and it should be because buying it separately will cost you $172! (UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE) It cost more than the console itself and currently there are no games with launch that will make use of more than one of this game pad. Developers have said that there will be games that will make use of two at a time but we are not certain if the consoles will handle three of these thing streaming at one time. You can also use the pad as a screen by itself to play some games without the TV which is pretty nifty! I would suggest getting the Wii Pro Controller which kind of looks like a hybrid between an PS3 and 360 controller. (I'm gonna call it the Wii PS360 controller) It is much cheaper at $50 but is still very expensive! The games I had a chance to play were Nintendoland and Luigi's Mansion. I liked the mini games! On Luigi's mansion the player with the touch pad is a ghost and the other players walk around a maze with flashlights. It was pretty cool! I think that you will like using the game pad but you will have to share and take turns with the kids but the games are very intuitive and they bring new possibilities to gaming!

They should have something like Apple's itunes that you can use to transfer media that you own. I can upload movies to my iPhone4 but not this thing.

Just got back from my sister's wedding. Oct to Feb is monsoon season so there are limited diving trip available in Malaysia. However, if you can make it out to Thailand, Krabi island is known for good diving site. When in Singapore:1.) It's a multi-racial country, so you can experience different food. Indian, Malay, Chinese, Paranakan, Indonesia and fusion. Hawker center or coffee shop is a great place to go for everyday affordable and decent food (entree S$3-5). Food court is mostly air-conditioned but cost more ($5-10). 2.) You can basically get to almost anywhere by either bus or subway or both, using pre-paid tap card. When going up escalator, stand to your left, unless you are in a hurry. It's rude to block the right side of the escalator. If you are taking a cab, it could cost easily $10 for 15-20 min travel time. Peak hours surcharge can double the fare, especially If you are going to the city, there are some other charges (ERP) as well. It's not a stroller friendly city if you are commuting by subway or bus. When travelling in cab, there is no car seat provided so if you are safety conscious, you may want to rent a car while you are there. 3.) Sometime it's not uncommon to hear people using English, Mandarin and dialect all in one sentence. Mostly commonly used local sland is singlish. Just add la or lo to the end of the sentence. I'm going to be late la. When someone says not bad"", it means pretty good. When someone says ""very good"", it means extremely good. It's ok to address cab driver or bus driver as Uncle or Aunty but just make sure that you are using it appropriately (not on someone younger, 20's)"					"4.) Nice places to visit include Sentosa Island, Garden by the Bay, Marina Sand Bay Water show (evening), Singapore flyer, Zoo, Jurong Bird Park and the Water Park."						yabb.ly/1Xiz6j			yabb.ly/qFlBwJ			yabb.ly/WpW2vC			( yabb.ly/ba1sUb)						"5.) You can usually find a neighborhood pool quite easily unless you are living in the city. They have much bigger neighborhood swimming facility (toddler, adult and Olympic pool) all in one place than in Seattle. "						"6.) It's a really hot and humid county, so dress light. The exchange rate is around US$1 to S$1.2-$1.3. It's also pretty safe country and people are willing to help with direction. So, feel free to ask. "						"If you are into food, below is a list of places that my sister recommended to a friend:"						1.) International buffet in Royal Plaza. They are usually booked full for dinner so call in advance if you plan on going there. 						yabb.ly/I3zp4Z						"2. Lucky Plaza Yong Tau Foo - after some orchard shopping, this is a good stop over for some local delight. "						"3. Toast box laksa - if she is into into spicy stuff. Otherwise a nice buttery toast with some hot coffee or tea can't go wrong. Not forgetting the runny half-bolied eggs. (Wendys : 328 Katong Laksa at 216 East Coast Road, Katong is good too. Most Chinese taxi drivers will be able to bring you there.) "						"4. If you like durian, you should go to Geylang ( near Kallang MRT Station) for it. Try the D24 durain from Malaysia or Thailand. Thats my favorite. Durian price can range from as little as 50 cents to nearly a hundred dollar per kg. Make sure to go with a local friend so that you will not be overcharged. Once durian is opened, the fruit stall owner expects you to pay for it. So dont let them open it unless you really want it. Make sure the seller weigh the durians before you agree to ""test"" the durian. Always try the first durian before ordering more. "						5. You should also try out Indian curry at any of these places. I like the one at Samys curry Restaurant at 25 Dempsey Road. yabb.ly/Oew2MH						"6. I love the Minced Pork Noodle from my old neighborhood, Blk 85 in Bedok North Street 4,#01-08. I always go with the soup version. yabb.ly/RigZbC. You should go there in the evening. I dont think they are open in the morning. "						7. Try the Claypot frog porridge at 235 Geylang Road (Lorong 9) yabb.ly/MrqXw7. This is one of the best Frog Porridges that I have tried. You should go there in the evening not for lunch as the heat and porridge will make you really perspire. 						"8. If you love Malay food, you should try the Nasi Lemak. You wont go wrong with any of these places. yabb.ly/Per4du"						"9. TWG at Ion/ MBS - many kinds of tea and colorful macroons. Their scones is a killer even though I am not into sweet stuff. Very nice decor and great for meeting friends for chit chat. Their hi tea menu seems very delicious too even though I had only tried their beef steak, very tiny portion and exquisite."						"10. Blu jaz at 12 Bali Lane - For casual/ outdoor dining or slow drink, this place has a variety of local, Mexican and western food. For local food, we recommend Sambal prawn with steaming white rice- not spicy spicy but with a nice sweet and a tinge of sour taste which comes from the pineapple and red pepper. Red bull bujitto is a good choice - non alcoholic with crushed peppermint and sugar. Very refreshing and gives her some energy for nearby sightseeing at Arab St and Haji Lane. They are open for Both lunch and dinner. Very popular place indeed."						"11. Ion food court, World Trade Center - for variety of local food like beef noodle fish ball noodle, hakka dishes and seafood too."						"12. Hide Yamamoto - High range, for quality and ambience. Chrys has never dined here but she saw a foodie friends posted on FB."						yabb.ly/SZ9Js8						"Enjoy the sunshine!"""			In that case Poom u may want to chime in on this Yabble :-) http://yabbly.com/question/893/have-you-ever-used-a-sweater-shaver	In that case Poom u may want to chime in on this Yabble :-) http://yabbly.com/question/893/have-you-ever-used-a-sweater-shaver		I agree w/ these guys--word processing is still one of my most pressing needs for a laptop as well an iPad--recently got myself 	I agree w/ these guys--word processing is still one of my most pressing needs for a laptop as well an iPad--recently got myself an Air too for that reason mostly.		That is a complex question!

If you're looking to process credit cards in person, you might consider looking at Square (www.square.com).  If you're just starting off and have low volume, PayPal is a good way to go.  PayPal's fees will eventually eat you up as your volume increases and you'll need to consider other alternatives.  As with any business, higher volumes mean lower prices.The nice thing about starting with PayPal is that many people prefer it even if you have other options available, so you can just add on an additional processor when your volume grows.  PayPal also allows international purchasers more easily than some merchant processors.On thing to keep in mind is that PayPal has very strict policies on following their policies so you'll want to carefully review their terms of service and respond to any customer complaints quickly.  PayPal has a bit of a bad reputation for just shutting off merchants with little warning.  I'd make a habit of sweeping your money out of PayPal and into your bank account frequently to avoid them freezing any funds."		"I found the iPad to be the best childrens console.

I know their commercials are corny but their staff actually knows what they're talking about and lots of times their deals are pretty close to what you'll get at Best Buy.

New generation Plasma's do not suffer from burn-in like first gen, and offer some really crisp blacks and color.  They are great for movies, but can suffer from reflective glare due to the glass screens.  LCD's are great all around and have a matte screen which reduces the glare significantly.  They have improved their contrast ratio and though not as crisp, they offer nearly the same picture reproductions as Plasmas do.  They also offer a great response time, which is perfect for gaming on them.

The are 1yr and 3.5yr. 3.5yr should be easy with iPad but 1yr old...		We bought  an Olympus Tough TG-820 12 MP iHS Shock & Waterproof Blue Digital Camera .  Its not bigger or bulkier than our iphone	"We bought  an Olympus Tough TG-820 12 MP iHS Shock & Waterproof Blue Digital Camera .  Its not bigger or bulkier than our iphones so you don't feel like you're hauling a big camera around.  I upgraded the memory card and can now store 2000 pictures on there.  We also have an older Canon Digital Rebel SLR.  Honestly, the picture quality of the Olympus Tough is better, way more megapixels and sensors, but you create better photos with the Canon because you can use optical zoom lenses.  And the biggest issue - imperceptible shutter delay on the Canon, slight delays on the Olympus.  You have kids.  Those delays drove me crazy when our kids were little.  The Canon's aren't bad, but if you are waiting for the exact moment take a picture, and you end up missing it due to delay, that's very frustration.  The other advantage to the Canon is you don't get the red eye issues which just seem unavoidable in small point and shoots.  If you're not going to be hauling the camera around a lot, I'd go online and find a used Canon body - they are readily available for around $300, and then get a small multipurpose lens (35-105) also widely available as used lenses for about $100. In the end, I think the red eye issue and the shutter delay issue rule out point and shoot"" cameras if you're primary purpose is take pictures of your daughter.  But if you need a camera which can go in a purse or a pocket, and have software to fix the red eyes when that does happen, those little cameras like the Olympus Tough series are very convenient and easy to use.  We do like ours.  I use it most of the time, but then use the Canon for pictures of my kids.  Good luck."""		"Thanks Brian, great info there.

The beach is beautiful and very very clean. It is very quiet due to the noise ordinance so you don't have to worry about loud college kids. Prices are very affordable and there is lots to do since its so close to Tampa and Orlando. You can usually find good air fare into Tampa. Best idea would be to get a bungalow for the trip. You can find them very reasonable online and they will have all the features of home and sometimes more. Hope this helps!

If she's indoor then I'd say don't worry about getting an insurance as long as she's getting vaccinated, getting her regular checkups, exercising on a daily basis and you're picking the best diet for her (ie. wet food instead of hard food). However, if she's outdoor (and a very active cat) you may want to look into some options since she will be more exposed to common but dangerous viruses to cats, such as feline leukemia virus (FeLV). I rescued my indoor cat and he's been with us for over 1 year without insurance.

And in addition to the basic coverage, I also pay a little more for some coverage on basic wellness.  I did this since my dog was 12 weeks old.  Insurance is prob one of the few things you purchase, hoping that you don't actually have to use it.  My initial thought process was that I didn't want to have to focus on the financial aspect in case something serious were to happen to my dog.  One of those low probability but big impact kind of situations.  My dog is only 4.5 years old and has had one ER incident but you would be surprised what just one incident could cost you in bills (easily a few thousand).  I'm not sure about a cat and how costly typical vet bills are where you live but I have been reimbursed in excess of what I pay annually for pet insurance (approx $400 annually).  In the year that we had to take him to the ER, insurance helped to cover a major portion of the expenses.  Also, double check but if you wait until the pet is older, the annual premium will probably be higher.  They factor the age of the pet when calculating the premium."		"As for my reimbursement experience, my vet will submit the claim for me directly to VPI.

I have also been very late in submitting claims (before I knew my vet would do this for me) and VPI honored all the claims.  It's pretty clear what is covered and how much you get reimbursed.  I wouldn't count on insurance to cover basic wellness visits, more for unexpected things that happen with your pet."		Take advantage of your staff and board.

If that's the case I cannot think of a better camera than a GoPro.  "					The HD Hero2 right now is being blown out at Costco and other retailers as GoPro just released the Hero3--but for an 8 year old the features of the Hero2 should be just fine.  Here's why I think it would be good:						*  Very aggressively priced			*  Uses standard SD cards (so no proprietary memory cards)			*  Cheap and plentiful accessories available at numerous retailers			*  Very high quality video (Hero3 is even better...Hero2 is not awesome in low-light but great everywhere else)			*  Practically indestructible			*  Super easy to use - only 2 buttons						"I don't know if the 8 year old is a boy or a girl but I could think of tons of useful situations for both where a small, lightweight, super durable camera would be awesome.  These things take abuse and keep on going.  The included waterproof housing turns your bathtub into an underwater video stage and is great for summer days at the pool or beach.  Their mounting systems work with helmets and bikes so your kid can become an outdoor adventure videographer in minutes.  The wide-angle feature lets them make hip looking videos.  It charges via USB so you can plug into any computer or standard USB charger for home or the car and top up the battery.  And additional batteries are cheap.  "						If your kid starts to get advanced there are ways to hook up external mics and accessories.  You can also link numerous cameras together with the WiFi BacPac (built-in on the Hero3) and control them with an iPhone.  If you drop them (I do and I'm 30...I can only imagine what an 8 year old could do to a camera) you can pretty much assume the camera will be just fine.  The cameras can do high speed frame rates for slow motion video.						"I haven't played too much with the software that came with it since I've already got video editing software, but it seems to be decent.  The only real drawback is that out of the box there's no LCD screen--that's an add on which may be necessary depending on what kind of filming your kid likes.  But if it's going to be strapped to a helmet or your bike you don't really need a screen.  I bought one but only use it about half the time."""			"Everyone, let's flood tom's inbox!"

So, instead of thinking about putting a bunch of checkboxes under the account settings, think about some kind of game, some kind of beautiful visual interactive experience, where it is fun to play with, organize, trim, and add to the themes/nodes of my Yabbly experience.For a simple analogy, check out areyouahuman.com, a company my friend started that took the painful experience of entering data into a captcha and turned into a fun game. For an example off the top of my head, imagine a simple game where the top themes of my thread appear as colorful balls moving slowly around a space and I have to grab the balls and put them into three different bins that say Love It"", ""Hate It"", ""Don't Care"". Or, to play on the Owl theme, maybe they are owls that are flying around and I need to grab them and put them into nests or on limbs of a tree."					"Not saying any of those ideas are Yabtabulous, but you get the general idea.

I usually desire to have something like this on hand to send to the dozen or so friends who want to purchase a ""good camera"" for the holidays.  The main idea is that the camera has very little to do with photography compared to learning technique.  I like to recommend some books on photography and then suggest a more advanced compact camera instead.  These cameras are more affordable, have most of the same features as an SLR (manual control, RAW file format, etc), and are far easier to carry around than an SLR + lenses.  People then usually ignore this recommendation and spend a ton of money an SLR that they won't use after a few months because it's too big to carry around and the pictures aren't any better than those they take with their current camera because they never actually tried to learn photography.  "					"I better stop my ranting.  If you've weighed the pros and cons and decided that you want an SLR, I can look for some good deals on kits that would suit you well, depending on your budget.  Alternatively, I can recommend some pretty awesome advanced compacts that would be an excellent stepping stone to an SLR.  The one I have is used constantly, while the SLRs now sit in the house except for paid work."""""			Bose is overpriced because they are over-marketed.

The only product of theirs that is decent is their noise-canceling headphones.I just wanted to chime in with another vote for Sonos.  It's expensive-ish, but super-high quality, well-polished software that runs on many devices, supports a ton of services, and sounds great.  If you ever expand your music footprint their ability to synchronize music cross-player is top notch (so, no echo sound from timing issues).It took me a while to buy a sonos system because of the cost (I am very cheap), but I have zero regrets.  It's that good.

The indoor/outdoor is okay if you like carpet, but put a moisture resistant pad under it otherwise it's just really hard - you'll want to vacuum very regularly because stuff just goes right through it.Carpet tiles are a huge waste of time, they slide all over, they're a real pain, especially on uneven floor.  They're really only good for small spaces unless you glue them down. Now the vinyl planks, they lay easily and quickly, are water resistant and okay in slightly damp conditions (like in a basement), have padding built in, float on top of the floor so they're easy to remove or even just to remove a piece (no glue needed).  The go down quickly, can be cut with a box cutter and snapped to trim or cut with scissors for around doors and such.I'm very happy with mine.  I chose vinyl specifically so it would float over an original hard wood floor to protect it, and because I can use bleach and other chemicals on it without worrying that it's going to cause problems.  My floor wasn't perfectly even but with how easy these cut, it was a breeze to put down.I got mine from Home Depot (order it online) for $1.89/sq ft (order 20% more than you need simply because of how they are set up to accommodate one another when piecing -- and I strongly recommend staggering the layout. I didn't in this room (see the picture) and while it looks good, staggered would have looked a little bit better.Vinyl planks also give you the ability to do a really fancy lighter or darker colored border around a room then fill it in with a different color wood"" in the center.  You can do quite a bit with it.  And the stuff I used is guaranteed for 25 years.

You do not want to waste the business owner's time.  Make sure to include a final date for their response and state that you will call them to follow up three days before that date (and do it).  To do that you'll need their business card and the contact person's name.  This provides accountability and gives you a nice contact list for future events.Then you take that printed document to as many businesses as you can -- IN PERSON -- and you give them a quick one to two minute statement about what you're doing and that you don't want to take up too much of their time now so if they can review and let you know what they are willing to donate (don't push them to donate on the spot) -- for a donation receipt in kind (this is big, if you are a 501(c)3 this can help you immensely) -- and that you'll follow up with them.  Leave them with the original printout and one extra (or ... make it so the one you give them has a piece that can be torn off and shared with someone else) because business owners know business owners and ask them to share your information with another business that they believe would be interested and would benefit from your event.While I know someone mentioned direct mail, it's expensive and most solicitations sent out that way get tossed in the garbage immediately.

That is usually a property developers would love to buy, but the permitting process will take longer than they can afford.  As a young home owner you can live there instead of renting, go through the permitting process, and then sell the property as a permitted development at a substantial gain.  Way better than just buying a house to live in.  This is how I bought most of my homes in my 20s.

You can't throw on a (real) telephoto or macro lens.  You can't always do the diverse shots you want.  You can't take 3-10 frames per second on some cameras (though more point-and-shoots are offering this).  And while you can adjust some controls you don't have complete control with a point-and-shoot (I don't know of any point and shoots that would let you put them on a tripod and take a super long starry night exposure for instance).  But as Jim pointed out--most folks don't ever take their SLR out of automatic mode, and those photos do turn out just as crappy as the compact cameras on auto.It's not so much about the camera but what you want to do with it.  I believe a recent cover of Time magazine was shot by a professional photographer using an iPhone 4S--so it really depends on the situation and what you're doing.I think Canon makes some of the best and most feature-packed point-and-shoot cameras.  They use common storage cards so you're not locked into proprietery stuff (remember the Sony MemoryStick?).  And you can often override certain things and play with exposure and such.  It's most important though to know how to take a good picture.  It doesn't matter if you're using an iPhone, a compact camera, or an SLR--if for instance you're at a concert and you take a photo and think you should use a flash, regardless of the device you're using you won't see much other than the blown out heads of the people immediately in front of you.  But I've seen people do it time and again with all levels of camera.One of the best photos I've ever taken was with a disposable 35mm camera--but I had a pretty good idea that I'd be able to get the shot I wanted based on my photograph knowledge which had been developed over years of taking lots of BAD photos and understanding what it takes to make a GOOD photo.  Knowing where to focus, how to focus, and how to override the auto controls to get what you want makes all the difference in the world--regardless of what camera you're using.  That being said, for SLRs I'm Nikon through and through.  They just make really durable and reliable equipment and have great lenses.  I second the suggestion to go to Glazer's downtown.  Their staff is super knowledgeable and in my experience doesn't automatically steer you towards any one product."		Cheap is stuff like elance or odesk.

Many are not, they're 2.4G only.  Using a wireless hotspot, I've only seen those in 2.4GHz.Second question: how many base stations can you see from your computer, do you see lots of networks?

If you decide to go to the dark side, I'd recommend using Blue Nile (I think I saved like 30% versus the offline jeweler).  As for the cost, I think 2 months sounds reasonable (unless you a ton of money or none at all).  The main thing is she's gonna have it for 10+ years before you upgrade the ring for her (if ever) so it's worth saving up for (e.g., less than 0.5 carats is prob too small IMO).

(PS: do not tell your partner this, they will get mad.)"						"I'd recommend just going to Blue Nile.  You can pick out basically exactly the diamond you want -- size, quality, etc.  Pricing is as good as you'll find anywhere for equal quality.

These are sort of on the border: they're in the invisible to naked-eye territory, but just barely.  Looking at the ring: it sparkles, it's absolutely clear, and basically looks perfect.  Yet if I had bought a ring with higher clarity / 'less' color it would have been over double the price and would have looked exactly the same to the naked eye."						"One other tip: often diamonds just under an 'even' number (ie, 1.23 carats versus 1.25) are less expensive, because people do searches for 1.25+ carats.  So, if you figure out a size, sometimes going a tiny bit smaller saves you several hundred dollars."""			"I may very well go with the Cruising"" option.

Some girls prefer quality over size and some want the biggest stone within the budget and care less about color or inclusions. Some girls want the diamond and what it represents to them. Some are horrified by the price and would rather get an alternative stone. These days it can be anything you want, sapphire, moissanite, opal, I have even seen pearl. It depends on what she likes since it will be her wearing the ring a llong, long time.       Whatever you choose, make sure SHE loves it. I would prob stay away from pearl or fragile stones. There are so many colored stones available. Heat treated or oiled will cost less than untreated colored stones.  If you go the diamond route, using a dealer will cost almost half of going retail.

It was for 30 uses.  Which ended up being a couple of months for me.  More than enough time to tell me that it was more than worth it to purchase.The software works on Windows machines, Macs, and Linux.  It can also back up or synchronize files from laptops, desktops, external hard drives, flash drives, and even online storage.  It supports various Internet protocols, including FTP, FTPS, SFTP/SSH, WebDAV, SSL, HTTP, and Amazon S3 web storage.  It can even compress or encrypt while backing up.I have profiles set up to copy from my primary 1 TB portable hard drive to three separate external hard drives: another 1 TB portable hard drive (Mac compatible), and two 2 TB external drives and most recently between several 3 TB hard drives and several computers.  I even have it installed on all of my machines (Windows, Mac, and Linux) with just the one license so I can keep everything up to date easily.  There are a ton of options you can set with how you want the SFFS to run, an exact mirror, copy from one side to the other, copy from both to both, smart tracking, and so much more.I set up the 1 TB > 1 TB to only sync a single folder (with many sub folders) from left to right and right to left  Ignoring deleted files on the left or right, and asking me when files are the same date but different size.  I have it set to run in attended mode so I can approve the updates if anything is to be deleted or over written. It looks at both sides, builds a file list, compares the dates/times, and sizes, then runs the program.And as it runs it tells you if files are larger than what theyll replace so you choose if they get over written or not (this is crucial if you have a corrupt file on your primary and are backing it up and you might over write a good copy).The 1 TB > 2 TB is set to copy from left to right and never delete anything on the right, but move files and folders if they are moved on the left.I ran the profiles for the duration of the trial and had absolutely no issues.  Everything copied perfectly.  And those backups came in handy a few times when one of my external 1 TB drives became partially corrupt from being detached incorrectly.Restoring files to the corrupt drive was simple, just connect, and run the profile.  So don't think of this as just a way to send data to S3 but also a way to back up everything locally and remotely.  Which you should always do since even S3 isn't fool proof.So whats the cost of all of this convenience? $60.  Thats it.  A one-time fee and you have a file backup program that will work for any and every situation you could possibly encounter.  And on all of your machines.I get nothing for recommending this software.  Try it for 30 days.  You have nothing to lose, and you may even save your data."		I have the same trouble with my 5 yr. old daughter versus her 6 yr. old brother.  A giant floor puzzle.  A bracelet maker.

Do you happen to know what kind she likes?  She might just like how pearls look without caring you much about details. In which case look for pearls with a nice sheen/glow and smooth finish.

I went to Tahiti for my honeymoon and the hotel water taxi took us onshore one day .. coincidentally you literally needed to walk thru the store to get into town ! funny thing is that we spent over an hour there looking at pearls - if you had asked me this question i prob cud have given you a much more educated answer! but I think the important things to focus on once you've narrowed the color down is to look for the shiny ones ! the ones with a smooth (small look bumpy) finish .. I wud also put them behind a white piece of paper and black piece..  I think also your wife;s skin tone might affect the reflection you're pearl is giving off so something to bear in mind. Mikimotos def have the brand ..but if you ask me - its hard to tell the difference... I got my wife a big strand of small pearls that you could wear in diff lengths - basically you could wrap it around your neck in different configurations .. I think turned out to be a pretty versatile gift ... happy hunting .. my last piece of advice - dont get caught up on how the damn pearl was made and how talented the grafer needs to be to create that 1 in 99 million perfect pearl ... you buy into this -even if its true -and you will start justifying the crazy costs.. and quite frankly no matter how much you spend on a pearl, you might as well get a diamond... diamond trumps pearl any day... so basically dont spend a lot on them pearls :) (paid for and sponsored by the Diamond Jewellers Association!)"		"@rschroed, we just released a new version with auto-selecting.

Maybe that's changed now.  I just downloaded Penultimate and have liked it so far.  I like to doodle and draw and make arrows and circles in my notes.

It's too hard to write though with precision I've found.  The Jot Pro is more like an actual pen tip.  My notes in Penultimate looked like I was back in 5th grade again.  I'm lefty and write illegible as it is...this was more like writing with a crayon.  So I'm really hoping that a fine-tipped stylus will change things.  Definitely really interested to hear if you find something that lets you actually move away from the note pad.

It's a French steak rest which of course u won't be able to enjoy but it's called Relais de Venise. They literally only serve steak n chips. No reserv.  There's another hidden gem on that street called Tomoe for great sushi. You will b surrounded by Japanese bizmen so u will know its legit. This is trad no frills sushi. Go downstairs n sit at the bar. For another amazing, Japanese go to Jin Kichi in Hampstead. It's prob 30 min from where u r but amazing grill. Get the grilled mackerel. I liked it so much I had it again for dessert. U will smell like a robata grill but sooo worth it. U need to book n once again rec the bar.  Old school cheap n cheerful Indian u have to go to Lahore Kebab House. The one near Aldgate. No ambience what so ever. They refurb a few yrs ago n now it looks like a college caf. It's sterile as anything but the food is damn good n dirt cheap. For high end Indian go to Amaya in Knightsbridge. Get the scallops. Oops forgot abt a great Fish n Chips right next to Woodlands, Golden Hind has been a fav for years.                     Another awesome Food Street that many people overlook is Charlotte St in Bloomsbury area. It has every cruisine. For one of my fav Fancy French places go to Pied a terre. Really good n not stuffy. Groupon always has deals. Across the street is Roka. If ur alone eat downstairs. It's more of a lounge but u can get the same menu. Same owners as Zuma. The thing about Charlotte St is that most of the people u meet will actually b from Central Lon. If u stick in Piccadilly u will find a lot of people who tech live in London but typically they've come into town for a big night out. If you like real n i mean authentic Szechuan- only one place for you Bar Shu. U can't do this on ur own or u will end up only getting a couple of dishes. Their sig dish is the sliced fish fillets ( remember in Lon the T ain't silent!) in boiling oil with dried Szechuan pepper corns n chilis.

There's so much information, it's definitely easy to feel overwhelmed. I went from deciding I was going to propose to having a ring custom made in my hand within 28 days. It was an insane process, here's what I can offer up as suggestions.1. Depending on your future fiancee's taste, that will dictate your price point. Eg: if she does not wear a lot of jewelry, you likely will not want to get a ridiculous carat size for the stone; if her hands are larger than average or she is really tall, you probably want to err on the side of caution and get a larger carat. I found that the 2 months salary rule of thumb was too costly and would likely get me something too flashy for my lady.2. Start doing your shopping in person to get a better gauge for pricing, stone sizes, differences in the 4 C's"" and overall style that you think she'd like.

I recommended the newer one to you which is off of Berkeley Sq.. but the orig is just as good... bar botanist, This is not really a place you go for food...its a restaurant that has a nice bar scene on Sloane Sq.. so end up meeting lots of expats, bankers and trust fund children of the above ..still a great scene but I think its more of a place in the summer when it spill out into the sidewalk and all of the windows are openned up ... samba nope, dont know this one Zuma,definitely a scene -its one of my orig recommendations.. sit at the bar and you will meet bankers and a lot of Mid East Tourists and American Tourists.. it can be slightly a slightly older crowd ..  bar at the Canought hotel, think the barman got some award .. but its prob more for pre dinner drinks. unless ur eating in the neighborhood dont think you need to make  a special trip just to have a drink at this bar.bar at Savoy hotel,Savoy has a great name but seems to attract American tourists from Ohio. enuff said. wright brothers, dont know.Amaya,this is the high end Indian I recommended.  le petite Maisondecent food -but you go more  for the buzz...Ok as far as your last question-  casual dinner and which one for a dressy/more formal one? unfort this really depends on what you're looking for and what cuisine you're really looking for - I know you're a veggie and dont want American .. so I'm going to have to give you a couple For Casual - I assume you're from the North West.. so I have to go with some mad good Indian and authentic Szechuan - stuff that I dont think the NW is necc known for - (sorry peoples)..  so hit up Lahore Kebab and Bar Shu..for a more formal dinner - I'm also going with something I dont think the NW has in spades.. nuevo french .. The Square, Pied a Terre,and for Seafood let me add to my fav seafood - J Sheekey !! best best seafood.. its part of Caprice Grp which also owns Scotts which is another Seafood restaurant - but I 've always found Scotts to be too old for me (I'm 42) and a bit sterile .. for some reason celebs still like to be seen there .. but what do they know about food !! ha hah ... To be J Sheekey is to Lon as Le Bernadin is to NY... world  class fish restaurants.. J sheekey is much more low key and relaxed by the way ,, feels more like ur dining in a pub. ok - I gots to go back to my day job.. Joe"		Made in Italy...great pizzas in Chelsea	Made in Italy...great pizzas in Chelsea		DONE!

They become part of our x-mas decor and the kids (and adults) love to look at them over and over.  Nearly everyone send a paper photo card now so it is worth the effort.  Vipin - I'm against the e-card.  It is guaranteed people are only going to look at it once and there isn't anything special or personal about it.  I personally like to send the paper photo card with a letter option on the back AND I hand write a sentence or two to each recipient.  I will also uploaded to FB closer to x-mas for the FB friends who don't make it on my snail mail list.  If you want to go totally electronic I'd suggest a quick web video or slide show over a more static e-card.  I've received cute ones from jib jab where the family puts in pictures of their heads on animated characters and creates a video that we as a family would watch more than once.

You have to wait 30-60 minutes after putting any lotions, makeup, cream, etc. on the skin before putting the pearls on, after you wear them you have to clean each individual pearl before putting them back into a padded case for storage.  They lose their luster easily if they encounter sweat, perfume, hair products, etc. so make sure she has all she needs to keep and store her pearls once you gift her a beautiful set.And, that said, they are beautiful, and I understand why your wife would like them.  I have many sets of real pearls, though I wear my fake pearls much more often because they just don't require such delicate care.I recommend, rather than go through all the trouble mentioned above to start her collection, and without going broke, in all seriousness, visit Kohls right now (kohls.com) and search for freshwater cultured pearls"".

I've billed out sites from $3,500 to $150,000 depending on the client and their requirements (most CMS sites run around $5,000-7,500 plus maintenance and hosting).Keep in mind that your job doesn't end when the site launches, you need maintenance on a daily/weekly/monthly basis.  You have to learn how to upload new content and media, how to update some of the code unless you have maintenance to cover it.  You need to know how to track if your site is doing well, if it's searchable, if you're using a CMS (like Wordpress) you need to know if it's up to date and protected against hackers.  If you are offering online services or sales then that's a whole new realm of work and capabilities.There's no easy answer to this, and don't limit yourself to people in your immediate area.  I have clients around the world, Canada, Japan, Brazil, USA, Australia, etc. and I'm in the middle of the US (I own a multimedia company and have been in the industry for 15 years).Location is irrelevant these days, find someone who can do what you need and more importantly, who can support it long term.Make sure they are insured (if they screw up your content and you have to honor a deal to clients, they should be liable for it), ideally members of something like the Better Business Bureau so you can research their complaint history if they have one, ask them to provide current references to clients you can actually talk to, and to show you live sites that they've done.Do your homework -- in the tech world you get what you pay for.  If you want to see some sample hourly rates you can find mine at http://discretiondesigns.com/about/rates/Note that mine reflect the level of my skills and my staff.  We design and develop multimedia for clients from individuals to Fortune 50 companies -- and we guarantee our work.

You may think that you'll only be there for sleeping but in fact, it's proximity to the strip, the vibe you get when you check in, go to your room, the niceness of the bathroom, quality of the beds, etc. must not be overlooked.

There are lots of new ones and I heard LOVE is really awesome (on my list of to-do's) but I find O to be my favorite.There are other activities of course and some highlights include the Gun Store which has a shooting range for automatic rifles but since you were asking about engagement rings before, I'm gonna stop there."		Great stuff folks.

The problem I'm trying to solve is to make it really easy for lots of people to see my current free/busy availability, reserve a slot or a few, for a proposed meeting, have those reserved slots show as busy for the next person looking to schedule, and then inform me of the requests, let me accept or decline, and then add it to my calendar.Doodle does a decent job of this in conjunction with Google calendar (my main calendar) but some people find it confusing, they often mess up the time zones, and it's multiple clicks for me to accept a time and have it added to my calendar.  In fact, every month I miss a meeting because for some reason it didn't add the event to my Google calendar (mostly i think because of the multiple clicks and a poor mobile experience).So my dream solution is for Google Calendar to have an appointment booking feature built in (which I don't think they have).

I think we can all agree the main appeal here is the coolness factor (which is ultra high).  Of course, it's less carbon (indirectly as Ferd points out) than a gas guzzler but no cleaner than a Leaf and probably only slightly better than a Prius.2.  If you accept that #1 is the primary motivator, it just comes down to how badly do you want to be the first one in town in a Tesla S and how redundant is this versus a critical path vehicle for the household.3.  Personally, I think I'd only buy if it was a tertiary car that I could afford to have in the shop for repairs and recalls a couple times a year for a week or two at a time.  Or I'd wait 6 months to see how the first batch performs in the real world.  I am nervous around Jaguars so gotta believe a first gen Tesla sedan choc full of bleeding edge tech could make Apple maps look good ;-)Buying first gen Roku is one thing, worst case scenario you switch to comcast or throw in a DVD.  Having a Tesla S crap out on the way to work seems like a major PITA if not a potential accident.All of that said, if I had a four car garage, already had 2 normal cars, I'd be tempted to get a Tesla but probably not the S base since it's not very fast and I'd expect a Tesla to be more performant so would have to get the 85Kwh model or the Performance model.  Otherwise, it's just a nicer looking Leaf ;-)However, if you're gonna pay $70K for the second-best Tesla S that is still slower than an Evo, and assuming you agree it ought not be a critical path car (you'll have a sedan and SUV as your primaries), why not get a Cayman S...So my answer is it's too early to buy one IMHO unless it's your 3rd or 4th car and you just love the idea of an electric car and are ok with turning down much faster and more reliable alternatives for the same price just because (or more likely because you already have those and are building out a small stable of toys which is totally awesome)..."		"To add to my previous post, an e-card is a good alternative to dealing with the post office when the intended recipient is outsi"	"To add to my previous post, an e-card is a good alternative to dealing with the post office when the intended recipient is outside of the US.

It's quite inexpensive, good quality, and good support.  http://www.callcentric.com/The only bad thing is it's a little tough to understand their plan structures at first.  They sell incoming and outgoing services separately, so you'll need to figure out which two plans work best for you.They're especially good if you don't want a lot of minutes (you will save a *lot* over similar services, like vonage, if you don't use a lot of minutes).  For unlimited plans they're still a bit cheaper, but the difference isn't as huge.Another option is getting ooma.  My mom has it (she uses a lot of minutes) and it's awesome.  You buy the device and from then on you're only responsible for taxes & fees.  Unlimited minutes, you can port your number, etc.  You can see what your monthly cost would be here: https://go.ooma.com/tax_calculator  (For me, it's about $5 a month for unlimited minutes).  Upfront cost is usually between $100-$200, though.I, personally, hate vonage.  They're expensive, their tech support is pretty bad, and lately they've been doing what I consider somewhat misleading marketing ($10 A MONTH! then in tiny print: for the first month then $30 thereafter).  But, basically, you can do a lot better than vonage.FINALLY another option is Google Voice via a special VOIP adapter.  There's this thing called the Obi100 (also the 110).  It hooks through to google voice and gives you, basically, completely free incoming and outgoing minutes through google voice.  It's pretty sharp.  A little trickier to set up than the ooma, but pretty solid.  Lots of good reviews.  http://www.amazon.com/OBi100-Telephone-Adapter-Service-Bridge/dp/B004LO098O/(You can port a number to google voice now, too, so it's possible to use your current number)."		And one more thing: since you're using DSL you might want to ask your phone company about what the cost difference would be for 	"And one more thing: since you're using DSL you might want to ask your phone company about what the cost difference would be for naked DSL"" (aka DSL without phone service).

For your price range, you can get a great house (even in the city; in the city you'd get a smaller house/yard but still a nice place).Property taxes are insanely low, thanks to the state constitution capping them at 1% plus levies.  Seriously: my house in Seattle is appraised at 4x the value of my mother's house in Illinois and she pays double the property tax as me.Plus, no state income tax is fantastic.  That is huge, especially if you live in NYC now (between city & state taxes, that's almost 10%).  [And sales tax, one of the primary income sources for the state, isn't much/any higher than NY.]  There have been attempts at passing an income tax but they've failed.  Even the more aggressive ones had tax rates that were at most half of what NY or CA have.The only -- only! -- downside of Seattle is it's depressing as hell.  It's overcast 9 months out of the year -- usually without break -- and that gets old, fast.  I've realized how bad it was even more now that I've moved out (to NYC)...

The biggest adjustment was getting used to having to have the water turned up all the way to get hot water. This is because the unit that I have only turned on when the minimum flow requirement had been reached. This is not an issue when taking a shower, but if you want a slow stream of hot water, you've got to turn the flow up all the way, then turn the flow down to your desired flow rate (and eventually you'll have to turn it back up because once the flow drops the heater will stop heating the water).I ended up installing a small local water heater under my kitchen sink to fix this flow-rate problem.I'm not sure this has anything to do with my tankless water heater, but some faucets take a very long time to actually get hot water. I'm pretty sure this is caused by a poor installation.Also, I had issues where my kitchen sink could not even cause a flow to turn on the water heater, so it was actually impossible to get hot water without also turning on the hot water in another faucet. This was fixed by cleaning out the aerator. (The small local water heater also fixes this problem.)In the end, my *feeling* is that tankless water heaters are great, but a relatively new technology and it will be another 10 - 20 years before they're as solid as standard styles.

The outside pocket is a plus for additional items that you want to put in without digging through your bag, like parking ticket, keys or iphone.  If you go with the Janice's Legacy, it's cute but you might end up looking for another slightly bigger bag to fit all your items a few weeks later.

It also has a racemic (half will either clog pathways or is useless, and contains contaminants) form form of Vitamin E, plus two possible MSG sources.  I'd avoid that like it was toxic.The GNC uses the good form of D, but still the bad form of E.The Nature's plus has several improvements: not only does it have cholecalciferol (D3), it has chiral (not racemic) E, so totally usable.  It also has K2, which is good to have in balance with D3.  It's also soy free, which helps reduce phytoestrogens.

Be sure to bring autograph books - each character mingles with restaurant customers and signs autograph books when they're made available.

Both will set you back just under $200.  The Maxi is the most stylish (the BMW of infant car seats), works with Quinny strollers, but some people complain about the thin padding, two hands required for the handle, and issues with the base.  The Chico was recently rated #1 for safety, has good looks, and is easy to install and handle.  But, some people complain about the low airflow fabric which makes it hot for some babies in warmer climates.There are many others that are fine and many parents say they ultimately made more of a deal about which brand and model than they should have.  Ultimately, so long as they have good basic safety features, are compatible with the stroller you have in mind, and most importantly -- are easy for you to carry and move in and out of the car, you'll be fine.

It will buy you about a year before you need to upgrade to a bigger car seat. The snug rider folds up nicely and is quite handy for travel. As for stroller the maclaren is great.  The umbrella strollers are great but lack the shocks of some other strollers. So if the stroller will be your only way of getting around with baby, then maybe look into the city mini which folds up easily (one hand pull) which has the bigger wheels so its a more comfortable ride and can help ywith snowy/slushy conditions. You won't be able to use snug rider on snowy paths. If you get around with a car then snug rider and maclaren umbrella stroller is just fine.

I feel like I want to keep some of the pulp and not go pure juice but since we use the juice as an appetizer before a light dinner, this isn't a problem.4.  Super easy to clean and put together.Overall, I love this machine.  I think our kids had more veggies in one cup than they did all last year."		We had a Graco Snugride with our first daughter and a Britax Companion (retired as of 2008 - the Chaperone is comparable) for ou	"We had a Graco Snugride with our first daughter and a Britax Companion (retired as of 2008 - the Chaperone is comparable) for our second; both borrowed from friends. The Graco was less bulky, but the Britax was more comfy for the baby (she slept in it all the time!).My suggestion is to test drive strollers (go to Merry Go Round in Bellevue, or try out your friends' strollers) and see what you like best. Then do the research to find out which car seats are compatible with that stroller (you will usually have to buy a separate attachment bar). I wouldn't buy a stroller based on a car seat because you'll use the stroller for a much longer time.Like others have already said, I really like the City Mini stroller by Baby Jogger for navigating sidewalk cracks and gravel and other uneven ground. It folds flat and is easily lifted in and out of our small trunk and fits behind our front door for storage. I've even taken it on the bus and it only sticks out a little from under the seats. Their car seat adaptor is designed to fit several popular car seats including those made by Peg Perego, Maxi Cosi, Cybex, Chicco, Graco and Evenflo.Keep in mind that it will be a relatively short time that you will use the car seat in a stroller. Both our girls are tall/long and outgrew their infant seats long before their first birthdays (5 months & 8 months). Plus, even if they haven't officially outgrown"" their seats, when they get bigger it gets harder to lug those seats in and out of the car so you might want to switch to a convertible seat sooner than later!"					You should also consider how often you think you will be taking your car and how often you will leave straight from the house. I found it easier to carry young babies in a baby carrier (like a Moby or a Beco) when I was leaving without my car rather than strap them into a car seat that they are likely to want to get out of to be carried anyway.						"I'm also wondering if you already have a Maclaren? If that's the stroller you like best, then maybe you don't want to invest in a bigger stroller that is car seat compatible. You could just buy a universal stroller frame (Like a Baby Trend Snap N Go) to use for the first few months. Unlike cheap umbrella strollers, you can use most Maclaren strollers without a car seat from 6 months old because they have recline positions and headrests."""			"I can't answer this question, but I'd love to hear the answer.

Is it in a 'good' rental area?  Is it easy to find renters and are they professionals or families?  What is your life situation?  Do you anticipate moving in next several years out of Seattle or are you pretty stable there?  Can you manage the condo on your own or are you paying someone for that?  How is your financial situation?  Do you have a pretty good excess of income every month?  Can you 'cover' a few months of the property being vacant without much trouble?  Ok... those are a few questions and now here are my thoughts... If you can keep that condo, it may be the best investment decision you ever make.  If you can have that mortgage paid for by someone else and then own it free and clear in 15-20-30 years, then the rental income becomes pure profit and most likely you will benefit from some appreciation.  Why not keep the rental, then take advantage of low interest rates now and go buy another home for yourself to live in.  Get a good deal on that and stay for a few years.  Buy in an area where it will be easy to rent in the future.  Stay in that place for a few years until you are ready to buy again.  At that point, you should have two rental properties that are paying for themselves and then you will have the home you are currently living in.  In less than 30 years, they should all be paid off and you will be making income on two of them.  Now, this is obviously assuming that the answers to some of the original questions put you in a situation where this all makes sense.  But if you can handle it, then this plan could put you in a great position in the future.  BTW... low inventory most often means prices are going to increase, not decrease...

But it does sound like you are in a position to go with a similar plan to what I laid out above (if u want). You could refi into a 30 year at low rates so as not to lose money every month. As rents go up over the years you should be able to start paying that loan down faster and still get it done before 30 yrs. but in meantime it's not costing you anything. Put 3.5% down and buy one more home that you can live in a couple years and then rent out. Then you can buy your dream home. Live there the rest of your life and have a couple of easy to manage investment properties that don't cost you anything and will ensure you some extra income when you retire.

It's also a matter of preference. I can't say I agree with the Lagavulin recommendation. It is a well made scotch but it isn't for everyone. The nicer Irish whiskies are very smooth, those include Midleton, Jameson 18 and Redbreast (which it sounds like you're already had). It's really hard not to like these, but they are expensive. Jameson is ~$100 and Midleton is $125ish.As for scotch, I would start out with Balvenie Double Wood. It's sweet and fairly smooth, with nice flavors that are easy to identify. If you want a smokey scotch I would go for the Laphroaig Quarter Cask or Old Ballantruan. Both are very good. If you can find Scapa 16 that represents some nice light flavors and a very interesting mouth feel. Scotch can get very expensive. I think these are mostly in the $55-75 range. Some distillers sell sets, usually in small 'airplane' size bottles, that allow you to taste through some different agings. Balvenie does a double wood, 15 year and 21 year. Those can be a lot of fun.Bourbon is probably my favorite of the whiskies and what I think represents the best value in the whiskey world. I would try Elmer T Lee for a nice sweet, buttery example or Four Roses Small Batch for a lighter example($30-40's maybe). Bulleit also makes very nice bourbon and rye. It's around $25-30 and is good on the rocks or in cocktails like a Manhattan. I know this is blasphemy but while Makers seems to be most people's standard, I'm not a big fan unless mixing it with coke - that's a delicious and hard to screw up mixed drink, but a different topic. On the pricier side of bourbons (which is mostly in the $60-$80), try Prichards Bourbon or Rye, both are very good. If you can find it, try any of Buffulo Trace's antique collection, however some of those are barrel strength which mean they were never cut with water and can get near 140proof. George T Stagg and the Sazerac 18 are probably the best of the antique collection. If you're drinking a barrel proof bourbon then make sure to add ice and/or water! Those probably aren't the best place to start for absolute newbies, but they are fun.Welcome to the whiskey world!"		"Great discussion, and one more thing to think through...could you get a greater return on that money and your time landlording t"	"Great discussion, and one more thing to think through...could you get a greater return on that money and your time landlording through another investment?

Takes you to major areas in hk or Kowloon and you can take a taxi to your hotel from there. And we usually opt for the convenience of cabs whenever possible but the airport train is that convenient. Also when returning to airport, you can actually check your bags at IFC before you get on the airport train to airport. No struggling with any luggage to the airport!  In general it's really easy to get around since all transportation is well designed. Taxis can be difficult to get during rush hour and bad traffic, especially on hk side. At night, if your friends have time, I recommend taking the star ferry from tsim tsa tsui to hk side (or vice versa) for one of the best views of the hk skyline. Splurge for first class which is prob under 1usd so you can disembark first. There is a nice walk by the water in tsim tsa tsui at night near the ferry too. Plenty of hotels and bars there after your walk. Things are open quite late. Some malls dont even close until almost midnight. Lan Kwai fong is a bar/night life area popular with expats.

The facility can provide them for a few bucks each but I find them to be lame.  Any ideas for something that's $5 or less and can be a cool single item we can give to each guest instead of a paper bag of disposable stuff?  I'm thinking a basket full of small animals like this and each kid takes one?  http://amzn.to/VN45Tv"		The seat warmers in the Cooper are great.

Another reason for hardtop over convertible is the rigidity of the chassis in the hardtop makes it corner better.   I got the upgraded (JCW) engine and brakes - both are significant.  I'd skip the Nav system, standalone ones will continue to improve while the built-in ones just age.  Do be aware that the Cooper is not a super-quiet car, nor is it a super-smooth cushy ride.  You're in a sports car, it's throaty and it's bouncy.  But you can outrun a lot of people who have no idea something that size can go that fast.

Dress in layers.. technical fabrics if you have them... Long sleeve tshirt... sweatshirt/fleece... waterproof shell. This will allow you take off layers if you get too hot.

I would also want to target by location in certain cases as a lot of my knowledge is location specific (Ann Arbor or Seattle, for example).   I think this works well for people with particular interests, especially if people/companies want to follow the Yabble on certain products.   And, in those cases, I do think the option of a daily push makes sense.When I reflect on what topics I respond to it is actually quite a diverse range usually related to something I know.  I might have a hard time coming up with a good set of criteria off the top of my head.   So, it would be great if Yabbly helped me learn my interest set and to prune/curate it over time with little effort.For example, you might consider something akin to a follow and unfollow feature or a +1 (but perhaps a different name) that lets me signal to Yabbly that I want to see more of these types of Yabbles.  I could then over time organically prune/curate my feeds.You might also considering having a personal analytics of what types of Yabbles I respond to and then use that as a tool to help people prune/curate.   I am imagining different graphs or word clouds that visually show my most prevalent categories, topical keywords.  Then, on that page, I should have a simple way (something akin to a follow/unfollow or a +1) to signal to Yabbly what elements are indicative of my interests.   On that page, you might also give me the option of giving Yabble permission to pull my facebook interests to help Yabble do a better job of recommending Yabbles to me."		"Aside from the answers above, Amazon Prime members who have Kindle devices can also access the Kindle Owners' Lending Library an"	"Aside from the answers above, Amazon Prime members who have Kindle devices can also access the Kindle Owners' Lending Library and borrow e-books for free."		Check out Las Brujas in Miraflores.

Our first Great Pyrenees was allergic to a lot of things; one time we had an endoscopy done, and 16 hours after eating the poor guy's stomach was still irritated from the meal.We put him on BARF (bones and raw food), he loved the raw chicken wings.  Over time he started showing some deficiencies, which we tried to overcome with home-made organic juicing and veggie supplementation.  He never got to real health.With our second Pyr, we tried some commercial raw food diets, but none of them really worked well for him.  We've got him on Mmillennium (yes, spelled that way) from Solid Gold right now, it has him (at age 7) romping like a puppy.

I bought a Foscam and tried it out with an extra Android phone I have sitting around the office.  Couldn't figure out a way to get it running audio but not video continuously in the background.  And it's kind of hard to fire up the device and app when it's dark in our room.  So I'm keeping the Foscam, but I think I am going to use it as a security cam for the front door instead of the baby monitor.My wife wanted to keep a monitor in our youngest son's room, so we switched to looking for something that could accomodate two cameras.  Turns out the Summer monitor that we have can accomodate two cameras.  So they are sending us a second camera, and we can switch between the two cameras on the single monitor.Sadly, we won't be able to use this to monitor with iOS devices along with an always-on audio/video monitor in our room.  But appreciate all of the feedback.  I think there may be a product opportunity here.  Someone should make a system with both a desktop monitor and access via iOS/Android."		"Thx all.

Everywhere else wanted at least $360, some were as high as $500.  Many didn't intend on using OEM glass at their prices, either.Also, it's unlikely you'll want to claim it on your insurance, since I doubt it'd be more than your deductible.(Note: if you catch chips/cracks early enough, insurance will pay for them to be repaired -without deductible- and without affecting your premium.)Also, randomly, I searched up Quality since it was highly recommended and found this groupon that should save you $50: http://www.groupon.com/deals/quality-auto-glass"		"OK, as an update for everyone, the doodle fix now adds stuff to your Gcal but...it does not set up Gcal reminders in the event b"	"OK, as an update for everyone, the doodle fix now adds stuff to your Gcal but...it does not set up Gcal reminders in the event by default.

The estimated repair $125."					"I decided to replace based on the risk of unsuccessful repair weighed against the risk of a defective replacement.  Four years ago I went through a series of four repairs that culminated in a very inconvenient ""demand visit"" for a new phone at 8:55 pm in Portland while on a road trip."						I spoke with eight representatives across the three involved companies regarding the first repair/replacement decision. Six of the representatives stressed refurbished phones were the best way to go and even recommended I always buy refurbished phones when upgrading.  						They all explained the testing for refurbished phones is more stringent than the testing for new production line phones.						I believe your decision should be based on whether you want to pay more for a higher level of confidence in the phone.						"Screen replacement won't involve any testing to speak of when compared to going with a refurbished replacement phone.  It is one thing to replace a screen, it is another thing to wonder if a small screen shard might be floating around in the phone post repair that could cause problems."						My background includes responsibility for the blood pump assembly used in the manufacture of kidney dialysis machines.  Dialysis machines that needed repair went through far more rigorous testing than the new production models.						One downside of replacing the phone is the need to re sync data.  Of course this might be involved with the screen repair also.						I didn't go with the refurbished replacement phone the first time I needed to deal with a damaged phone and regretted it.  The second refurbished phone has worked flawlessly for 8 months.						"Hope this helps."""			"I would take a serious look at Michael's answer above for starters, I also suspect your work may be in part causing the problem."

Synthetic latex is a petroleum-based product, no greener than memory foam.  2) If you're after the slow melting into the bed"" sensation you get when lying on a Tempur-Pedic, you won't get that with latex.

I've seen chiropractors, some have been amazing (too bad you're not in this area, I highly recommend Dr. Brent Symes, Downtown Edmonds Chiropractic); others not so great. The first visit is a tell-tale sign of things to come - if they just want you to hop on the table so they can adjust you after a 5-minute conversation, I suggest leaving. But if they do what they should -- schedule a longer-than-normal first appointment, use a non-invasive method of analysis such as checking for hot areas of your back, possibly x-rays, etc. to really figure out the extent of the issue, and THEN making a recommendation as far as whether to adjust manually or using less invasive methods such as a drop table or activator (a small, not-at-all-scary hand-held device), before making any adjustments, this could be a good chiropractor. I would post requests for recommendations on any/all social media platforms, ask around, and then research online to see what reviews say (weeding through the ones that are obviously fake of course). And ask for exercises, stretches, etc. before you leave. Usually they have hand-outs already available. Our bodies are incredibly complex and as you can see from many of the comments and your own experience, any number of things can be causing this. But in my opinion and experience, a good chiropractor is the best professional to help diagnose and treat your symptoms. They often suggest other forms of treatment and refer out to massage or physical therapists, acupuncturists, etc. etc.Sorry for the long-winded response!

I wonder if that has anything to do with it...Here's what I think so far:Apps: Two thumbs up! Even though the total number of apps is apparently considerably less than what is available for iPhone (I was an iPhone 4 & am still an iPad2 user), I haven't found this lacking at all. There's been an app for everything I've wanted.Call quality: One thumbs up. The speaker is louder than my Smithsonian-bound iPhone 4, calls seem to be clear for the most part and haven't had any complaints although it does take an extra second to connect the call I've found.Stability: One thumb down. While it is more stable than my last windows phone (which in the interest of full disclosure was several years ago -- possibly Windows Mobile 3.1 or something like that), I have had to restart it several times in the middle of the day. The symptoms have been things like audio volume being very low; home button non-responsive; and Galaxy"" text not showing up on voice commands. Admittedly I don't shut the phone off ever so perhaps there's some memory leakage or something that wouldn't be apparent if I put it to sleep more often. So in direct response to your frustrations Ferd, yes I commiserate here."					Functionality: Two thumbs WAY up! I didn't progress past iPhone 4 so I didn't have Siri and don't have that comparison. But I LOVE the voice command	" love the speech to text built in to just about everything, LOVE the navigator (not as thrilled about AT&T Navigator, I've been using the native version) with turn-by-turn, street names spoken, etc."					"So I give it 4 of a possible 8 thumbs up (1 point per up, -1 per down, no change for neutral, a zero score would be totally neutral, -8 being a horrible rating, +8 a perfect rating and yes I'm making this up as I go)."						"Overall, I am mostly enthusiastic about it!

But everyone seems to have different luck--some people respond really well to chiropractic care and others don't.  I even find that I can only go in the afternoons because I'm just too stiff in the morning for my body to really move correctly from a chiropractor.  I'd give one or two a shot to see if you like them.  Some use tools like (activator or actuator or something like that it's called...it basically nudges things back into alignment) and others do manual where they actually use their hands to manipulate your body.  I prefer manual but have had success with both methods.  One thing to note is that many chiropractors try and get you into a routine...they solve your immediate problem then recommend maintenance"".  Which you may or may not like.  I usually go every 2-3 weeks for an adjustment when I'm not having serious issues.  That works best for my neck and upper back issues."					"For my lower back, I've found chiropractic only goes so far.  This is based on my particular issues--again it's different with everyone and every issue you may be experiencing.  But I found chiropractic couldn't solve all my low back issues.  "						What did help was massage therapy every few weeks (weekly at first till you get things loosened up and moving right). And I combined that with physical therapy.  When you see someone for PT they should have you come more frequently at first and then taper you off as you build the right strength and start doing the exercises and work on  your own.  I've found that the things I've learned from PT have allowed me to alleviate much of the low back pain I've dealt with post-car-accidents.  						"I now have a set of exercises for my core strength that I do every morning.  Days I am good and do them I find I have a significantly reduced pain throughout the day.  Days I skip I find myself having problems by lunch.  You'll have to force yourself into a routine but once you do you should hopefully have a lot fewer problems.  Lots of the low back pain comes from strengthening the core, as mentioned above.  It's funny how much your abs and stuff actually effect how your low back feels."						"Overall I'd definitely try PT, chrio, and massage, and see what set of things work for you.  And I've definitely found that keeping up with the exercises my PT taught me allows me to be much more pain-free in between any kind of doctor visits.  It's nice to be able to alleviate your pain yourself without meds or a doctor visit.

Most people take a shower (hot) before they go to sleep which does not help in falling asleep even though you try to go earlier to bed as your body temperature is too warm.

Now, nothing beats a nun wielding a wooden ruler to improve your posture, but if you don't have one hanging around, you may want to try some of these helpful tips I've learned over the years from friends and professionals:1) An ergonomic chair. I've tried the swiss ball and that is good for strenghtening your back as well, but a chair that can be adjusted will help tremendously. 2) Give your back a break by getting up and stretching periodically at least every 30 min.3) Raise your monitor. This will help to keep your shoulders from hunching4) lumbar rolls are great for the office or the car and travel well.5)Strengthen your back with exercise.(Yoga, stretching, light weights)Have a friend take a picture of you when you are sitting down working when you are not aware. This will add some insight to why tour posture is poor. Adjusting your habits and environment should help to remedy your posture problems."		Well so far I haven't noticed anything at all.

I have W8 on my personal laptop and I don't really see the point of it. Unless your Thinkpad has a touchscreen, Windows 7 is a lot better in terms of file accessibility and ease-of-use. W8 looks cooler, but it's kind of a hassle since the Start icon is now absent and is replaced by the overlay Windows 8 start. Also, I haven't found a good use for Windows Store apps yet. Reason to Upgrade:-Faster bootup/shutdown times-Cooler aesthetics-Better search functionReasons to NOT Upgrade:-Too much of a pushaway from Win7 accessibility-Traditional (non-touchscreen) laptops aren't the primary target for W8-May have to relearn basic functions"		"@Kiel, also check out Recycled Cycles in Fremont if you aren't ready to go all in $ (or you are).

There is only one handle on the outside, it has no external pockets, and it's capacity is just short of most other maximum-allowed-carryons at 40L (most others are 45L).It's a cool design, and lightweight but lacks in features. For that kind of money, I might recommend something like the Tom Bihn TriStar (http://www.tombihn.com/travel_bags/TB0940.html) or Western Flyer (http://www.tombihn.com/travel_bags/TB0950.html) which are both high-quality bags which are well-regarded and handmade in the USA in Seattle, WA.

Translated from geek: it should run a lot of applications faster.But the user interface is a mix of a pretty version of Windows 3.1 (think 1991) and a great phone/tablet interface.  In my department at work, I have a head of IT/Ops who gave up on 8 on a new laptop and put 7 on instead.  And a real high-performing developer who had to turn to Google to find out how to turn his new laptop off after struggling for 15 minutes.  I tried both the beta and release candidate versions, and the UX had no advantage and lots of disadvantages on a desktop.In short: Windows 8 has some awesome features behind the scenes.

Powerful magnification with a small field of view (which you're limited to with a compact) is really hard to hold steady.

'Outliers' was probably my favorite. While training for the Seattle To Portland bike ride, I listened to Brian Tracy's Psychology of Success. This is a long book and I could only listen to an hour at a time, then digest it for the rest of the day.  Long book, but worth it and definitely one of my all time favorites.I'm not sure what you have read already, but Dale Carnegie books are classic. Dated, but still relevant. Stephen Covey's 7 Habits was also great, but I found the material very dry and therefore king of a grind to get through. I enjoyed JC Maxwell books as we well. They are short with great stories and relevant. Hope that helps."		Want to hit a couple of types of trails.

Medical technology is advancing like crazy, particularly with regard to stem cells.   They're already figuring out, for instance, how to regrow someone's ears, nose, and possibly even things like eyes, organs and arms by using stem cells.The key is that this technology is just starting to develop -- and there are immense possibilities of what could be done with it.   As legal restrictions open up and scientists accomplish further breakthroughs, I anticipate that stem cells (obtained from core blood) will start to have some serious implications for someone's viability for potentially life-saving (or at least life altering) medical procedures.So, obviously you'd hope that she won't need it -- but given the rate at which things are advancing, I'd say it's a good thing to preserve given if she does end up needing it, it could really help her."		I agree with the heart/star crowd.

Despite conflicting reports on the viability of the cord blood (and stem cells which can also be banked now), we rationalized that we would be more upset if we decided against doing it and found out we needed it over the scenario if we paid for the cord blood/storage and didn't need it or it turned out to be a waste of money.

You get the best of both worlds by not being the one who pays the broker but you get someone who represents you. If anything goes wrong, the broker will advise you without there being a conflict of interest - claim payments don't come from them and they wont hold back on what you are covered on, or entitled to.  Also, getting car insurance and homeowners under the carrier will often come with a discount for both. "		Agree w @vivian.

It's said to be compact, easy to maneuver, and stable so your beginners can enjoy themselves but it's still pretty easy to maneuver at 48 pounds.  Also, brand new it's $400 so you should be able to find one used for $250 and since it's a pretty popular model, it may be impossible to find.The main complaint is it's a beginners yak so it may not be the most agile boat in the water, the cockpit is probably too open (great for ingress and egress but not for for weather protection), and the seat is not comfortable after a few hours.  Here are some links:Video of a beginner not tipping over: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3UCaNpmkA4Detailed reviews on Paddling.net:http://www.paddling.net/Reviews/showReviews.html?prod=2403Cheapest we could find new for $379http://www.austinkayak.com/products/1258/Old-Town-Vapor-10-Kayak.htmlHope this helps!Yabbly Concierge Team"		"Ironically I haven't JB'd yet, since I had an app update and turn my 5 into a heat source.

There are amazing (free!) resources online these days - pick any brewing method and search YouTube - you'll find hundreds of step-by-step tutorials. Don't bother with home-espresso machines because most don't have enough pressure to make really good espresso. I personally use a insulated Boudim french press(http://www.amazon.com/Bodum-Resistant-French-1-0-Liter-34-Ounce/dp/B0093EPC3O/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1360343799&sr=1-1-spell&keywords=younug+french+press), but AeroPress (http://www.amazon.com/Aerobie-AeroPress-Coffee-Espresso-Maker/dp/B0047BIWSK) is a great option if you are making a single cup.Back in college and high school I worked as a barista, so I can confidently tell you there are just a few simple things that you'll need to master:Water quality - filtered is best, and this is often overlooked.Water temperature - people often pour boiling hot water over their beans and scald them. The ideal temp will vary based on what brewing technique you select, but it's never a roiling boil.Time - until you become a pro use your phone to set a timer (again based on method). Too long of a brew will turn the best roasted coffee into bitter sludge.Beans - obviously the thing most people focus on, but it's actually the least complex part. Just buy quality, whole beans and buy in small batches so it stays fresh. Grind yourself just before brewing.Enjoy!"		"It might look nice, but I'd question horizontal boards in Seattle.

There are rear-facing seats with 5-point harnesses in the trunk and they get a kick out of facing backward and watching the traffic as we drive.  Kind of like the old Volvo station wagon.It is a lot of fun to drive.  Instant acceleration (no lag), very responsive handling, and the regenerative braking means I don't have to put nearly as much wear and tear on the brakes.Managing everything from a huge touch screen is fun and intuitive.  Feels like an oversized iPad.

But as someone who has wanted an electric car for a long time but never saw one they would actually want to own, I have to say this is the real deal.As to acceleration / performance, I'm not particularly concerned with 0-60 times, and if you are, you should get the performance version (0-60 in 4.4 seconds).

My wife's boss had her windows replaced and recommended theccompany highly to us:  Valley Glass.  The low cost really made me suspicious but I decided to get a bid.  I also had four other major name companies bid the job.  The bid range went from $7,000 to $24,000 based on vinyl vs fibreglass and low E option(s).To me it was fairly clear the decision was vinyl vs fiberglass and the low - e option was a given.That $7,000 bid was for windows that seemed to be every bit as good as the more expensive options.  Fiberglass really increases the cost and I don't think it is worth it unless you know for certain you will be in the home 25+ years.  I eliminated fiberglass quickly.I took the $7000 option and did not regret it.  For one thing they replaced a split pane window per original home construction the other's said could not be done.   They did the installation in one day and the installation was absolutely clean and flawless.  As for service I can't say because the windows have been flawless for seven years now and a service call has never been needed.  The windows are clearly as well built as the more expensive major brands I looked at.Valley Glass is family owned since 1946.  http://www.valleyglass.net/index.phpAs an aside I believe two of the four majors are no longer in business and a third is essentially selling off valuable divisions and shutting down the rest of the company.  Valley glass is still there."		"I'm with @Jim, I'd have the hardest time if I had to go back to a VT100, or worse, an ASR33."

The Roam 2 is the simplest action camera you can get. No 	"It depends which GoPro model you are considering (white/silver/black). The Roam 2 is the simplest action camera you can get. No bells and whistles, easily the best combo of form factor/versatility of mount options out there.  There is no power button. It's either on and recording or off. Huge savings on battery life. Image quality is good but not a huge step up from the original Roam. It does add 60FPS at 720p with good enough quality for web sharing but still a little rough around the edges if you want to do anything high resolution. That said, 1080p/30FPS looks good. Currently the only way to change settings or review shots with this camera model is via a USB connection to a computer.With the Hero3 family you get Wifi, way higher quality still photo mode (and video depending on the model), and the ability to change your settings and review shots (via the LCD backpack accessory which costs extra). Button controls are less than intuitive but not horrible once you get the hang of it. The white and silver editions have the same picture quality as earlier GoPro models but the Hero3 Black steps things up significantly with pretty much the best sensor/lens/processor combination out there in the action camera market. Is it overkill for filming yourself while tumbling down a hill? Probably but quality is gorgeous. It also takes outstanding still photos and includes a burst mode that Contour does not have. The biggest sacrifice is form factor. Great for auto, can mount to a bike decently, chest mount seems to be a favorite, but you look like a complete and utter tool with one of these on your helmet and you do feel it if it's on your head. The Contour form factor does is much more stealth and lends itself to be mounted on the side of a helmet or to a bike frame (don't mess with handlebar mounts no matter what your option, they all suck).It's really only fair to compare the Hero3 family to Contour's higher end offering the Contour+2. It takes everything great about Contour's form factor, gives a noticeable bump in video quality through some serious tuning, and also includes Bluetooth and an iphone/android app that can act as a viewfinder, remote control, and a place to tweak image settings in the field.It all depends on what you are looking for. Is ease of use and form factor most important (get a contour)? Are you looking to make film-quality edits or just share stuff on youtube/vimeo (GoPro or +2 former, Roam2 latter)? Is image quality the most important factor (Hero3 Black)? Connectivity and the ability to tweak settings without a computer (GoPro or Contour+2 but Contour's app and setup is way more intuitive)?Happy shredding."		Surely!	Surely!		"Kevin, super helpful!

I am much more comfortable (and see it as a positive and helpful thing) if Microsoft or a local mobile phone store owner responds to my Windows 8 questions and is identified as a business.

That, and once they're dull, they're effectively useless. Steel knives--good ones--can be dropped onto counters, bumped in knife bags, and sharpened for years under heavy daily use. That said: if you can be VERY careful in your treatment of the knives--never drop one, never set it down too hard, etcetera, and if you don't use it for an hour or more each day, you won't find anything sharper, nor anything that stays sharp as long. If you drop it, you'll throw away the pieces, and in a couple years, you'll throw away the dull blade no matter what, but otherwise, you'll be thrilled. In my own relatively quiet home kitchen, I went with very good steel knives (mostly Globals, with a couple of Shuns), because I didn't want to be afraid of dropping one every time I picked it up. They're easy(ish) to maintain, and a joy to work with, but not quite as sharp as the ceramics I played with in the store. If you can live with the drawbacks, ceramics are a joy to use.

Use it every time, just before you use your knife.  It only takes a few seconds -- swipe the blade on each side 5 times, then 4, then 3, then 2, then 1.  http://www.amazon.com/J-A-Henckels-9-Inch-Sharpening-Steel/dp/B00004RFMA/Sharpening only needs to happen once a year or even less often, if you keep your blade honed.  I'm going to go against what Ted suggests and say you should never sharpen your own knives.  It's not that expensive to have a pro do it, they have significantly better hardware, and they're not going to hurt your knives.

If California Adventure has early entry and you are not eligible, it doesn't make sense to run over to Cars Land at opening because the early entry people will have flooded it by then. We made that mistake and the young kids I was there with had a 1 hour wait as their first Disney experience! :("					"If you can, I would suggest having one adult stand in line with all the tickets and get fast passes for Radiator Springs Racers while you take the kids somewhere less crowded like Bug's Land & Paradise Pier (our 3-6 year olds LOVED the rides there best even though they weren't the coolest for the adults)."						"Another place that was fun to do first thing was Toon Town. There are some days (non early entry days) that Toon Town opens an hour after Disneyland, so you have time to do the Dumbo ride and the Teacups (and one or two other Fantasyland rides) before heading over and being first in to meet Minnie & Mickey (do Minnie's house first, it's smaller)."						"Something I didn't remember from my own childhood trips to Disney is how every ride has something scary - even the ones intended for the youngest riders! Our kids are fine with fast roller coaster stuff, but they were really scared of the dark tunnels and moving characters (Radiator Springs Racers & Ariel's Undersea Adventure among others). I wish I had talked to them ahead of time about what it would be like and avoided rides that were entirely dark scary tunnels like Mr. Toad's Wild Ride."						It is also good for kids to know ahead of time that many of the characters are really big and that most of them can't talk.						I agree with @Albert that Ariel's Grotto is great for princess lovers and worth the price to have personal attention from up to 5 princesses without waiting in any lines! But it may be too late to get reservations at this point. Call as soon as you can if you want to go!						"It's also very good advice not to try to do too much. You are there to have fun - it's not fun if you are frustrated with kids who are melting down because you tried to do too much! Plan to stay up late once for a parade or light show, but go to bed early on the other days. Our kids benefitted from going back to the hotel mid-day for a rest or a swim so that they didn't get overwhelmed by the parks. Honestly, they liked the hotel pool just as much as the rides!"""			One annoying thing about it -- the cutout for the buttons on the left side makes it asymmetrical.  I went with the Elago Outfit.

In the long run each change in temperature, humidity and light exposure really does impact a slide.  A  consideration is that JPEG files don't color correct nearly as well as TIFF's.  I would consider selecting a small group of what you consider to be the most important images and have them scanned to TIFF format.  These will be very large files.I personally would send a test set of 10 slides to perhaps three companies then to Blurb.  Make sure the slides vary in color and look for slides with lots of dust and lint on them.Here are  are a couple fairly well written reviews:http://www.techhive.com/article/2000199/the-best-and-worst-services-for-digitizing-your-photos.htmlhttp://www.macworld.com/article/1143504/outsourcescanning.htmlOne thing I noticed is use of Nikon scanners by at least one other service.  I own a Nikon scanner and they have a feature called Digital Ice that removes dust and lint spots by using pixels next to the flawed area to cover the flaw.  To me this is a plus.The closer you get to Christmas the longer the turnaround for both scanning and printing.The  test runs are as much about turnaround and how they physically pack and ship your slides.  To be honest with you the quality of scan will be a function of the individual(s) doing the work, not the company.  (Professional photographers pay Master Printers big $)My perspective is based on high end scanning and printing.  I spend about 1/2 hour per slide for a clean 4000 dpi Nikon scan with multiple passes.    I send out my A"" tier slides to be drum scanned at 10,000 DPI.  Very expensive but necessary for high end large prints."					"Hope this helps."""			I took a follow up poll last night.  My 7 year old boy liked Legoland better than WDW.

That said, we have a Nespresso in the office and it does get used but only when we don't have the time or cash to go to a coffee shop.  If we had the money, we'd probably get a superautomatic maker for the office or a burr grinder and an aeropress.  Admittedly these are slower, messier, and not as convenient as the pod alternatives but if you love great coffee, it's worth it.

I found that a bit odd. When you see a family of 4 with luggage and strollers spill out of a van the logical thing to do is to assist them. No one bothered."					We went straight inside and the kids camped out in the TV viewing area which made a 10 minute checkin work. Nice touch. We were upsold on concierge service for $250/night which seemed like a lot based on what they described we'd get so we passed. We then proceeded to the rooms.						"The elevators are fast with 4 zooming up and down at all times and we never experienced a wait, including our first ride up. The trek to our room was long, but the room was in a quiet part of the hotel which was nice."						"Upon entry to the room we scoped it out and found that it was a nice layout. The ceilings in the hotel are a bit ""low"" compared to higher end more modern hotels, and the bathroom space was pretty small with a tiny tub and no stand up shower. But we were happy with what we found, and it proved to be a comfortable place to get away from the crowds and nap / relax."						Our first issue in the room was that the pack n play was broken. It took a few hours to get this resolved with the hotel where they first claimed they send another one up (did not) and then ran out (did not) but then after my wife called for the 2nd time we got one we could set up.						"We attempted to head out and grab a bite, which was impossible at all the restaurants, but discovered a seldom visited ""grab and go"" type place to eat past the theme park entrance by the pool. We used this place to grab cereal in the morning and so on."						"On our first morning we ordered breakfast from 6-6:30 so we could take advantage of our ""magic hour"" early entrance to the part at 7am. We got a call at 6:35 that our breakfast (coffee and pancakes) would take another 15 min. That was a bummer. We cancelled and they offered to comp our breakfast the following morning. That was nice. Turned out it was a better plan and deal to just eat breakfast around 9:30 in the park since by then the kids were famished and lunch was another 2 hours away."						"The entrance to the grand California hotel is literally in the hotel and we got to take advantage of that twice. The extra ""magic hour"" alternates days between Disneyland and California Adventure. Our 3 day pass happens to coincide with 2 California Adventure days so that worked out well."						"The line can be long in the hotel, and we got there about 10 min before the opening and got in about 10 min after opening, mainly because the process of scanning people into the park is a bit of a cludge with multiple people inspecting your card, taking a photo (or checking your photo scanned on an iPhone), checking your bags, opening a door for the stroller and dealing with general issues. The best way to describe entering the park is that it's like boarding a 747."						"Anyway, after about a day or two we really started to appreciate the hotel. It's pretty much inside the park, with entrances to California Adventure and Downtown Disney where you can walk to Disneyland or take the Monorail into the park. "						The hotel definitely felt like a really nice Marriott hotel with the price of the Ritz Carlton/Four Seasons. We did not eat at the Napa rose or the other restaurant as we always found them to be crowded with lines or reservations that were a challenge to get on late notice (this is a reminder to book all your dinner reservations way in advance). 						The pool was simply packed to the gills every day. Every chair taken. But the staff did an excellent job keeping plenty of towels available and making sure none of the dozens of kids were drowning or jumping into the pool. 						"Our kids had a great time and we'd probably stay here again. I'd be interested in trying the Disneyland Hotel since it was renovated in 2009 to compare. No one I know has stayed there since renovation, and everyone we talked to recommended the Grand Californian hands down. For the price it's hard to justify the quality of the product, but you are paying for other conveniences staying here and judging by the crowds, this hotel has no problem staying full."						I have to shout out to the housekeeping staff who were amazing.

The downside is we have tried most of them already.  We have three waterproof mattress pads (the protective backing seems to wear out over time so we rotate), she's been tested for food allergies and avoids the prospective culprits, she stops consuming liquids well before bedtime and goes potty twice while getting ready for bed.  She is a very happy and smart girl, so I don't think it is stress.  She wants the wetting to stop and is open to trying an alarm, but it is recommended that we wait until she is 6 for that.  My mind has been in the Leslie and Stephanie camp for quite a while now, meaning I believe it is developmental and she just needs time.  We are willing to wait it out with her if that is the case.  My question is at age 5 do we go back to pull ups, or would that suspend progress or send the message that we have given up on her?  She says pull ups would be OK."		I have the Allen deluxe 3 bike trunk mount which fits my needs. It's affordable and pretty durable.

The salt will make any unwanted protein hiding in them ( naturally occuring worms, especially for farm-fresh produce) literally come out. Soak for about 1/2 hour - and then rinse off with normal water. Carrots - recommend scraping them off with a knife - hold the carrot above a sink with one hand ( by its bulbier top) - then with the sharp side of a knife, position it about 90 degrees and scrape agains the carrot skin AWAY from you.

Say you earn 20,000 points, those points are redeemable for up to $200 in travel (air/car/hotel). You can book travel through their online website (Travelocity partner) or you can book your own travel, pay for it with your  Venture card and then file a claim to use your points to essentially reimburse yourself for up to the total points you have available. The selling point is that there are never any blackout dates. Very true, but the value of your points actually fluctuates as airlines, hotels and car rental agencies, increase or decrease their prices during the times when you want to travel.

They run a little small, so you may need to order a size larger. I like Monaco in Pacific Place for their simple solid color pieces for casual or work.  Mercer in U Village has more high quality, interesting design pieces but the price is on the higher side. Some of the Brand names in Nordstrom can also be found there. When i'm looking for more of an unique piece, i would go to Bcbg. It's more pricey so i usually just buy it during sale. J Crew style is quite close to Artizia in some way and they are in Pacific Place. Have you shop there?If you are looking for something new or different, there are a few neighborhoods with a number of small boutique stores carrying vintage clothes or local designer pieces that you may want to check out like Fremont (along Evanston Ave N & N 36th St) , Ballard (Ballard Ave NW between NW Market St & NW Lone St)  and Capitol Hill (On Broadway & Pike/Pine District)If you like more high end European clothings, just walk along1st Ave from Midtown towards downtown and you will find several of them. Happy shopping!"		"I had to replace a single tire on our car (Audi Q5, AWD) when the set had about 1500 miles on it.

I'm not sure it'd be on the top of my list if you have minimal time.  The Science Museum is one of the best - VERY hands on, something for everyone - a guaranteed hit, but plan to spent the better part of a day there.  Don't bother with the Childrens Museum for that age or expect them to blow through it in 2-3 hours.  Duck Tour IS great.  I would only do Harvard Yard if it is nice weather.  If you do, kids love climbing the stairs of Widener Library.  The Harvard Natural History Museum is a small gem too that kids that age will love.  It can be done quickly if you don't have much time. If it is nice weather our favorite thing to do is walk from Park Street through Boston Common (hit the playground on the way), Ride the Swan Boats in the Public Gardens, and from there hope over to the Esplanade where just west of the Hatch Shell there is a GREAT playground for your aged kids - with a 2 story climber and a zipline - yes - a short but bouncy at one end and super fun zip line, that they can do all by themselves and love.  Max Brenner Restaurant is an indulgent favorite if you want a chocolate treat.  My kids love the brunch at Cafe Fleuri which has a chocolate fountain for dessert.  Anywhere you go is educational in Boston given all the history.  I saw that they resurrected the Tea Party Museum - small if you want history, there is also the USS Constitution if they like big boats and you want educational."		"That looks like a pretty low profile tire, so the tolerances will be tighter than on a higher sidewall.

Gas is easy to regulate by sight as you can see the flames and determine the heat level.  Induction requires a bit more faith in that area as you only have the dial.  The pot bottoms must be completely flat so this is a must for induction so the extra expense there.  The same pots work great on gas as well.  Induction sounds cleaner but after a few years of scraping and polishing the surface we found that it became scratched and unsightly.

As a rule, tire tread depth should not be off more than 2/32 across the axle (side to side, not front to back).

And don't let the tire company force sell you tires because it;s the law"" or ""company policy"". Find your lowest price on the tire. Drive to your local dealership, buy the needed tire there and ask them to price match it. I know it's a GM or Ford, they will. Don't however buy them at Walmart or Sears as they are supplied with company specific models of brands which means you can only get them in certain regions at Walmart or Sears and not outside those retailers. ALSO.... check your collision deductible.... if it's only $100 (which is the trend), then hitting a pothole that damages your tire and wheel cover, as well as the necessary replacement on the opposite side of the axle... those are covered."					"I just got a Mac and some Yabblers recommended Sophos to me yesterday.

You do not want to get into a money trap, and parts for the  German made Volkswagens are much more expensive, as is the labor. In driving a bit of an older car, you are going to have to expect for minor repairs here and there. Japanese cars are the way to go, specifically Hondas. They are cheap to maintain, run forever, and due to the mass amounts of Japanese repair shops, the labor costs are driven down by competition. Parts are cheap as well.

It means you're not stuck to a specific airline, it means you can book whatever ticket you want.  But the simple 1 point = 1 dollar stops holding true if you use your points to book upgrades or business/first class tickets.  You can find tickets where you're getting $3 or more per point on a higher-end ticket.  So, you lose that aspect of 'real' miles.Chase Sapphire is different in that they allow you to get native miles with an airline via transfer.  Seems like a good mix of flexibility and earning.All that said, I'd also suggest you consider just a cash back card.  Cash is good for anything, and it's pretty easy to find a card that earns at least 1.5%, and some offer 5% promos that can bump rewards higher than that.  I have the Chase Freedom and typically earn between 2 and 2.5% cash back over the span of a month's purchases.  I also use the capital one cash card which earns a flat 1.5% (and, as someone mentioned above, has no foreign transaction fees which is very nice when traveling)."		I'd look at Daily Grill on 7th and Pike they have amazing burgers and comfortable atmosphere for kids.

Therefore I run my own email server (qmail based, with jms1's patch kit) with the best AV detector, ClamAV, on it.  This is the only process that's kept the PC's I have completely clean.  I got whacked by a virus once on a WinXP laptop.  It was 10 days and 14 days before McAfee and Norton could even detect it.  Had it been running ClamAV it would have been blocked, they had a definition before it got to me.  The basic problem though with any AV software is they update signatures based on people reporting infections; that means some people get infected before the definitions block it.  So a multi-layer defense in depth strategy is a good idea.  Use an email service that uses ClamAV (gmail does I think).

I had a lecture in graduate organic about this topic, digested below:The octane rating is a measure of the activation energy needed to combust spontaneously under temperature and pressure.  Higher octane ratings allow the use of higher compression engines, so the combustible fuel/air mixture can be more compressed, allowing for more power when it does combust.  Thus putting a higher octane fuel in an engine will do nothing for its power unless the compression is also increased.See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octane_rating#Examples_of_octane_ratings for examples of what gives different rating."		"@Calia, there's  a startup to address a similar issue to the one you raise: http://www.geekwire.com/2012/tether-technologies-inc"	"@Calia, there's  a startup to address a similar issue to the one you raise: http://www.geekwire.com/2012/tether-technologies-inc-2/"		"Brooks, how is that turf at dealing with stubborn weeds coming up from underneath?

I recently sent the below list of recommendations to a friend who was going with a bunch of people to celebrate his 40th - so the places might not be what you want ... he loved STK and Lavo in the list below.. I know exactly what you mean about being let down by celebrity chefs and Michelin Starred ones .. trust me I've been to plenty- that said  - I have to chime in on Le Bernardin that Vivian recommended - I cant say enuff good things about this one - Seafood to die for (and I'm Chinese so I'm used to eating the stuff fished out fresh from the tank in front of me!) service that is not snotty or overbearing .. I've been in London now for many years and really always tend to use Le Bernardin as my standard.. I've been to the Fat Duck when it was the #1 restaurant .. Gordon Ramsey's Royal Hospital Rd .. Alain Ducasse's in the Dorchester.. Raymond Blanc's Quat Sasons.. I would say the only downside of Le Bernadin is that its a bit too formal for my liking.. kinda of exactly what you would expect from a fancy French place .. but trust me once you sit down you realize that its actually pretty relaxed (as much as a fancy place can be!).. Additionally the other restaurant that I miss the most and tend to talk about is Hatsuhana on 48th bet Madison and 5th (theres another one on Park)http://www.hatsuhana.com/hatsuhana .. I cant say enuff about this place.. make sure you get a spot at the sushi bar when u reserve .. the place is pricey .. but you do get what you pay for. ...  I love Nobu - but this place is traditional legit old school Sushi .. they dont try the fancy stuff - just amazing suppliers - my tip is offer the chef a shot of Shochu or whatever he wants and he will take care of you ! one time one of the chefs showed me his secret stash of uni ! and all of the fatty salmon he was hording away for his regular customers ! luckily I eventually became a regular ! Gray?s Papaya Hot Dogs !!

This is the way I understand it.@tom in that case, Arco is not a good gas to buy."		"After using both the Chase United and Marriott Visa for a while, I thought I'd look at other cards to see if I was using the rig"	"After using both the Chase United and Marriott Visa for a while, I thought I'd look at other cards to see if I was using the right one, especially considering new models like Capital One that allow you to use it anywhere. After looking at our own spend and travels, Chase United makes the most sense for us...more value than cash back and the value from Capital One. Plus, we can use the miles since we generally take longer, more expensive flights and use the 2c/mile rule. So the key is to look at your own spend and points usage to see what's right for you."		Hi @charleen great question!

Brooklyn Bowl is a perfect place to see the hipster in his key habitat.- Foodwise, you should either go High or go Low.  For Low I mean don't forget about bagels (Russ and Daughters!), pizza (Keste or Co.!!!!), brunch (Shopsins), dumplings (RedFarm) or noodles (Chinatown) etc.  For Foodie paradise try to hit Smorgasburg in Brooklyn, Eataly in Flatiron, or Essex Market in the LES.  For High food I second Marea, Ma Peche, and Bernardin.  I also recommend Del Postos in Chelsea, Perilla in the Village from the Top Chef winner, the amazing Annisa from Anita Lo, and any of the Michael White pasta spots like Osteria."		"Green Lake Jewelry Works (which is actually located near Northgate) has some very beautiful, intricately detailed pieces.

The University of Washington uses Sophos for the machines and this is where I first encountered it. I have also been using the Astaro gateway for the last few years with great results and it was acquired by Sophos a year or two ago (with no negative consequences). Now, when going to the Avast site today, I noticed that they now have a free anti-virus product for the Mac as well. I have not had a chance to try it out yet, but may give it a try since I have had such great experience with their Windows products.The big thing for me is real-time scanning. Both the Avast and Sophos products offer a real-time scanner as a part of the free offerings. They also offer email scanners, although in my case, email is scanned at the gateway so this is less of an issue. I have also found the products to remain invisible (no performance issues) unless there is a problem."		Scalinatella is an AMAZING super authentic Italian restaurant that Ryan and I LOVE.

So it doubles as an external battery in a way."		"Hi @Deanna,We decided to look into the Miele Speed Oven for you and found some pros and cons.The best part of the oven i"	"Hi @Deanna,We decided to look into the Miele Speed Oven for you and found some pros and cons.The best part of the oven is the dual-functionality and the programmable memory function which you can use to program in cooking times for your recipes. It also seems to work well as a daily microwave.The biggest gripe people seem to have with the oven is cleaning the inside - it?s very difficult because of the way the oven is shaped. People said that the cleaning process required them to turn the oven up to 200 degrees, turn it off, and then clean ? a long process for sure.The manual is apparently not very helpful and there is a learning curve to determine which function is more appropriate for different types of food. The oven also needs to be turned up to a very high heat to make pizza (which may require some time if you do happen to be cooking for 10-20 people). Another minor gripe people had was that the door opens downward like conventional ovens and unlike side-opening microwaves.A few other speed ovens to check out are GE?s Advantium 240 (yabb.ly/Gaoe0S), which offers similar functionality for a lower price, and AEG speed ovens (yabb.ly/hBPQNB).We hope this helps you in your decision. Let us know which one you choose and what you think. Thanks!-Yabbly Concierge"		I have been very happy with the Bose. Great sound 	I have been very happy with the Bose.

Since it's pre-paid, the taxes, etc are very low, so *two* lines with unlimited everything (talk,text, data) is $100.70 per month.Downsides though: (1) T-Mobile coverage isn't as good as others, so if you go off the beaten path, you'll get disappointed at times. (2) Our data plan is 4G for the first 200 MB per month, then 2G (?) afterwards. Hasn't really been an issue for me yet.I think that you can similar pre-paid on AT&T and others if those networks are better for you."		Business travelers know best and they say AmEx Starwood Preferred Guest.

Really deciding depends on exactly what 'around town' and 'backcountry' mean, and deciding what the primary reason for getting the bike is.Will around town include the highway? The KLR can survive there, the DRZ can't. Is the backcountry dirt/gravel roads, forest service firetrails? the KLR is fine on these. If by backcountry you mean real dirtbike riding, whoops, outlaw/powerline riding, the DRZ (or even a 250) is going to be superior.My first bike was an NX650, a 650 single quite similar to a KLR. The 650 will be better if you ever have a passenger and is a great do-it-all type of bike. People can and do take 650's on real offroad adventures, but smaller bikes just make more sense here. If the main purpose of the bike is to spend all weekend in the woods (and you don't have to take the highway there), get a smaller bike like the DRZ."		"Can't figure out how to edit my response, but I noticed you said it's your first bike.

Depending on your height/weight, the KLR might feel too tall or the DRZ too short. This can be a dealbreaker. Lowering a bike isn't that difficult or expensive, but you can't really raise one.Neither of these is likely to be too powerful for you, so don't shy away from the KLR for that reason. Take the MSF basic rider course if you haven't! Usually very cheap. Skills you need.

You don't sound like you're going to be doing dirt wheelies, so the larger bike won't impact your dirt riding experience either.The exception, as mobabo points out, is your physical size. If you're small-ish I can't really recommend either bike. Unfortunately the list of dual sport bikes for smaller / shorter folks is pretty short.

If that's the case, according to the government crash testing http://www.iihs.org/ratings/summary.aspx?class=15 the two top picks are the Acura TL and Volvo S60.  It's interesting to note that cars like Mercedes and Audi which you'd think would do well do not as well on the govt's new partial overlap frontal tests.  Perhaps the TL and S60 were just engineered in time to optimize for that test but that probably doesn't change your decision.Now that we've got safety down to those two mid sized, four door sedans, I ignored smaller cars like the TSX because of your great interest in safety, it comes down to reliability.  As a Honda man, you probably know Acura is owned by Honda and enjoys great reliability.  The Volvo S60 is not as well known for its reliability (it's not horrible, just average).The only thing I'd add is spring for the TL AWD model if you want more safety when driving in the rain.  I will add one curve ball that just occurred to me.  Have you thought about a small SUV like the Acura RDX?  It's a couple hundred pounds heavier than the TL, is a crash test top pick, and in general SUV's are said to be more survivable than sedans with equal weight due to the height advantage (SUV's have a 30% higher survival rate than same weight sedans).  http://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1061355_latest-safety-stats-new-suvs-are-safer-than-sedansThe one slight drawback is the RDX is super reliable but probably not quite as reliable as the TL and is 2 MPG less efficient."		"I second:Walking on the Highline (from 34th street to lower Manhattan) - lots of places to nibble but I am not able to speak t"	"I second:Walking on the Highline (from 34th street to lower Manhattan) - lots of places to nibble but I am not able to speak to it first hand.IF YOU want to walk over the Brookln Bridge (take the 6 train to end) into Brooklyn Heights- 2 places you should NOT miss ( ok maybe 4)Noodle Pudding ( gnochis to die for - all cash, reasonable)The Vinegar Hill House ( reservations for 4 or more, but you shoudl be able to get right in before 6:45 PM) - take the F train from Manhattan, or the A, C, into Brooklyn, first stop into Brooklyn.

The one I chose for my vacation home is the Honeywell model RTH8580WF.  The WF stands for WiFi and it easily hooks up to your wireless and can be set and controlled remotely through a free website they provide.  I can even do it from my old Blackberry.  It is an easy set up and costs about $140 at Home Depot.  That is about half the cost of the Nest.  If you don't need the thermostat to automatically change settings based on your pattern of use then this is the one I would recommend for sot and ease of use.		"I agree with @Gary and @Tom.

Here is what we found: Redwood Security Systems (https://redwoodsecurity.com) is one of the largest Bay Area-based security companies. They do offer installation and servicing, and they?re certified by a lot of organizations (check the bottom of their homepage for the entire list). In the last 3 years, they?ve had 0 complaints against them according to the Better Business Bureau (they?re A+ rated). However, it seems that some customers have had problems with rude customer service. Something to look out for if you decide to go with them.Escobar?s Security Plus (http://www.espalarm.com/) is also Bay Area located and has been around for over 50 years. Their webpage is pretty bare right now (they say they?re currently developing a new website), but based off the services/features they list, it?s worth an email if not a call. They do partner with national security company Bosch, so they may not be able to meet your local need.Bay Alarm (http://www.bayalarm.com/) seems to be more contemporary than the other two (just by the look and functionality of their site). They?re local and they say they will customize your security system to fit your needs. However, a lot of customers seem to be having problems with them raising their prices mid-contract. That?s something to make sure you establish before you go with them (if you do)The Bay Area is huge and there are a lot more companies that can offer an alarm system, but we hope this helps you find a few potentials.

Do I get extra points for agreeing with the CEO?  j/k   My personal choice is a dedicated PC with PowerDVD to play blu-ray movies.  That way any source from the PC can go through the nice display.  Also, PowerDVD does some smoothing and up-sampling to make DVD's look better.One big thing to remember with blu-ray is the need to update the player constantly, as there's an arms race between them and software like AnyDVD that decode the keys to allow full features.  So the keys are always being updated, and whatever you're playing them on needs to be up to date.My second choice would be a Sony PlayStation, as they are the originators of the blu-ray format, their updates tend to be the fastest."		"Thanks Tom, will look into that more. Side note, noticed Yabbly is in the Seattle area, glad to see people from this area comi"	"Thanks Tom, will look into that more. Side note, noticed Yabbly is in the Seattle area, glad to see people from this area coming out with quality products."		"Not a specific restaurant, but the restaurants and bakeries in the Latin Quarter are really amazing.

The yabblers above raise some good points though.In general, larger firms have a marketing person to handle social media issues (bad review of a product, poor experience, general customer complaints).  These are usually met with a marketing-biased response, but it *is* a response from the company.  Unless it's total BS, you want a company that cares enough about their customers and their image to make this effort.Smaller firms use social media as a way to get their messages out there (their budget is far smaller, and social media is essentially free).  I would really love to hear back from a small firm on a post I make, whether it's positive, negative or inquisitive.  It gives me a sense of how well the product/support will be.*This mechanism should be used for responses only*.  Companies should not post as users on yabbly.

It will be replaced for a new senz, no questions asked!-The senz has an unusual shape which makes it fun, different and innovative.

The number of modules is self explanatory.  The module rating is the name plate rating on the modules which indicates how much wattage that module generates at any given moment when it's exposed to the sun.  The peak sun hours are site specific.  It is a measurement of the amount of sun that your area gets on a daily basis over the course of the year.  More specifically, how many hours per day do you get the equivalent of noon day sun, (I am assuming Seattle, WA in this case).  Finally, the de-rate factor. Solar modules and inverters are not 100% efficient so you have to account for some losses.  All PV systems also lose 2-3% due to wire runs.  The de-rate factor is taking into account all of these losses from when the electricity is generated at the module until it is back-fed at your utility meter.Since you've given me your average daily kWh consumption I can dummy this pretty easily for your house.  It would look like this: (136 modules) x (Yingli 245) x  (3.76 peak sun hours) x (0.79 derate factor) = (136) x (245) x (3.76) x (0.79) = 98,973 Watt Hours/Day or 98.97 kWh/Day.  Therefore a 33kW system (136 x 245 = 33,320) using 136 Yingli 245 modules would off-set your entire usage (provided it stayed the same as it is now).  Since I have never seen your roof I can't imagine you could accomodate that big a system.  The average residential system in the US is only 5kW.  A 30kW system is a small commercial system- unless you have a Hollywood sized home.  That said, roof space is usually the limiting factor for most solar customers so it's common that solar customers don't zero-out"".  "					"In addition, a lot of the buying decision depends on finding ""the sweet spot"".  This is usually the point at which you are maximizing the available incentives under the prevailing billing structure from your local utility.  For example, many utilities establish a baseline usage at a specific price and then increase what you pay per kilowatt hour as you exceed certain consumption targets.  This is a tiered system- very common here in California.  For example, a customer might pay $0.12/kWh for the first 250 kWh they consume each month.  For the electricity they use between 250kWh and 400kWh that price might go up to 0.15/kWh.  Any kilowatt hours they consume above 400 kWh might cost them 0.30kW and so on.  Down here many utilities have 5 tiers like this and customer find that if they can eliminate whatever they consume in tiers 3-5 they can maximize their savings.  In other words, they may purchase a PV system that only off-sets half of their consumption but lowers their bill by 75-80%."						"I am launching my own solar company that will be doing residential and commercial systems.

Just look out for salespeople trying to sell you jeans that are a tad bit too small, it seems to be something that a lot of people are facing with this store.Plenty (http://www.getplenty.com) carries clothing that are minimalistic in design, and the colors are usually more neutral. It?s a place to buy well-made clothing, but with that quality will come medium to higher-end prices. Check the second floor for men?s clothing and shoes. As the name implies, there is plenty of stock inside, so you may have to dig a little find a perfectly unique article of clothing. It?s worth a look though!Hope this helps guide your search for great men?s stores on Robson Street. Enjoy your Vancouver trip!-Yabbly Concierge"		Escalantes here in Houston makes a great fish taco using shrimp rather than fish.

Here's my thoughts on it...1) I get mixed reactions from people on the other end of the line - sometimes I have to just pick up my phone.  I've never owned anything but Jawbone, so this may just be something about bluetooth - it's never as good as wired.2) I have a beard (trim, but there) which may be causing issues with the mic as it touches the skin.3) I use it frequently for just listening (I listen to a lot of audio books) when around the house, working out, driving while the kids listen to something else, etc.  For this it's awesome - good sound quality, solid connection, long battery life (the ERA gets a solid 5 hours and charges in no time at all).4) Their support is TERRIBLE.  I had one that was 6 months old peter out on me, and they denied the warranty claim because they said it was purchased from a non-authorized seller (I bought through Amazon and apparently through a 3rd part seller although it was Amazon fulfulled).  I shamed them on twitter and got a replacement. All that was after fighting with customer service for 2 weeks.Honestly given the support issue I may switch next time I buy a bluetooth, but since they replaced it in the end I'm keeping what I have.  Just make sure you keep your receipt and buy from a proper seller - which means you'll probably pay full retail."		+100!  Kudos to @heatherchristo!	+100!

We?ve compiled three of the most unique & fun sounding attractions for kids as well as adults:Castaway Cay is Disney?s private Bahamian island ? it has snorkeling, bike rides, parasailing, glass-bottom boat tours, and rentable inner tubes. It also has a water slide and open-air barbecues. Out of all the things to do, this seems like one of the most cruise-unique attractions to check out.The live stage shows are something to not miss ? check out Disney?s Believe live show for an once-in-a-lifetime (unless you go on the cruise again) musical starring Disney characters from multiple movies. You should be able to find a schedule for the showings once you?re actually on the ship or online.Animator?s Palate, one of the restaurants on the ship, is actually not an ordinary restaurant ? it has screens all around that immerse you into the world of ?Finding Nemo.? The sea turtle Crush ?swims around? the restaurant by way of the screens and actually interacts with diners. A fun show for the kids, a great meal for adults.Here?s an article to look over to find things for the adults to do:Top 10 Things to do on a Disney Cruise for Adultshttp://www.everythingmouse.com/top-10-things-to-do-on-a-disney-cruise-for-adultsWe hope this helped you get some idea of some must-check-out venues for the kids and adults on the Disney Dream Cruise.

The fees are pretty high (though they do try to make them sound low) and the diversification they give you isn't that amazing to pay what they're charging.

Please note, though, that there are things that can cause interference..I got a new glass sliding back door that has some special coating for energy efficiency and that doors weakens my signal outside. I installed an access point near a downstairs window that is old, so this gave me back my strong signal. I've used several Netgear wireless routers over the years and bought & installed them for my sisters and we are all very happy with them.

But I also believe that there will be big picture features that design should take time on where a structured sprint may be too fast paced for the type of exploration needed to address the full picture. In these cases I think design should be two sprints (assuming a 2 week sprint time) out from dev at least to allow time for more iteration and prototyping. There are also exceptions in the other way. Some features can be small enough that design can front load that feature at the beginning of the same sprint in which the devs implement the feature. 		I think you can't have it all for just $3000 ;) proper equipment would go beyond $6000.

"Thanks Alex, though I had wished there was something new I could pick up.I'll echo your preference for balanced microphones.  The signal from a microphone is pretty low voltage, so a small amount of interference from surrounding electronics is more likely to generate noticeable interference on a single-ended (unbalanced) connection.  The balanced connection (typically on an XLR connector) means any induced signal in the wire between microphone and electronics will be induced pretty much equally in both sides of the signal, while the microphone's information is the differential between the two signal wires.  This effectively nulls out the interference when using a balance connection.  A single-ended or unbalanced, while cheaper, is more prone to carrying the interference all the way through."		The Q5 repeatedly wins top compact lux SUV awards.

That will certainly help you through the entire experience.  That being said, it depends what you're going for.  If you're looking to learn the real way (interested in theory, making your own music etc.) nothing beats one on one lessons or classes.  If you're just looking to pick up and play for now, I would recommend learning tablature first (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablature).  It's very self explanatory and is easily self taught.That will help you start playing right out of the box.  Once you start getting your fingers used to the movements (and you've learned the basic scales and chords) you should check out a book that explains the theory and notes.

If you want to buy a new iphone for a prepaid plan it's a good way to go, though (bear in mind you're getting a kinda-old-but-not-terrible iphone).Straight Talk is, generally, pretty good.  It runs on T-Mobile's network so you'll have similar coverage compared to what you have now (though you won't get roaming, so it will be a somewhat smaller network).Another provider to consider is Simple Mobile (www.mysimplemobile.com).  I've used their $40 plan (which includes all taxes, so it's $40 out the door) in Seattle and it's pretty solid.  Similar to ST, it's on t-mobile's network.I believe you can use either of them with an unlocked iphone (if you're out of contract I -think- AT&T will unlock it)...  but I'm not sure about how well 3G will work.  You may only get edge because they run on t-mobile's network which uses different frequencies than AT&T.  I have heard there are changes afoot but I'm not privy to them so I have no idea if it's still true.One other thing to consider *if you don't care about talk minutes*, t-mobile has a prepaid plan that's $30 a month that includes 100 talk minutes and unlimited text/4G data.  It's a killer deal...  for introverts :).  I'm on this now and have tried pairing it up with voice over the data network and have had pretty poor success, so I'd really only suggest it if you intend on using <200 or so minutes a month.  Otherwise paying the extra $10 or $15 for Straight Talk or Simple Mobile is likely worth it to avoid the hassle.If you're getting a new phone and willing to try something different, the Nexus 4 works perfectly on both of the networks above (4G and everything).  It's only $299, and comes unlocked so you just pop the SIM card in and things work.I do encourage you to switch to prepaid...  there are some HUGE savings compared to legacy plans."		"@Jim Thanks for your response!Straight talk runs on Verizon's network, which means I'd have really good coverage across th"	"@Jim Thanks for your response!Straight talk runs on Verizon's network, which means I'd have really good coverage across the country (great for road trips through the middle of nowhere in Idaho and Montana). I have a Nexus S, and like it, but it's slowed down and battery life has dwindled as the operating systems get bigger.

I don't personally have a Lenovo, but they do offer many lightweight, portable options. One of the newest is the IdeaPad Yoga 13, which is both an ultra book and tablet combined into one. It's less than 3 1/2 lbs, up to 8 hour battery life and the screen can physically flip into 4 different modes. One mode is like a standard laptop, another flips it into tablet mode, and there are two more positions in which it can be positioned. It also comes with Windows 8. There are also the ThinkPad Carbon X1 and ThinkPad T430, which are the ultra books. The Carbon is more of a premium model. The T430 is very popular with businesses, though Lenovo will soon come out with its updated model, the T431. These are similar to standard laptops, though smaller at 14, and usually come with an SSD instead of an HDD (types of hard drives)."""		"I agree with air_conditions.

"I've done both - driving there for the day (there and back from Ka'annapali in one day) as well as staying there for 5 nights.  I think it depends on what kind of experience you want.  You can do it in a day - it is a fun fast paced adventure that way if you want to do a number of stops/hikes along the way and beyond.  You end up in Hana around midday - which is a great time to grab some lunch.  Staying there overnight or longer makes it a tropical vacation unto itself because it is so different there than the other side(s) of the island.  The individual bungalows at the Hotel Hana Maui are the place to stay for a treat."		Mbp>viao	Mbp>viao		i am looking into 3 options:  basis health watch (mybasis.com) ; fitbit flex (fitbit.com/flex) ; and amiigo (amiigo.co).  none o	"i am looking into 3 options:  basis health watch (mybasis.com) ; fitbit flex (fitbit.com/flex) ; and amiigo (amiigo.co).  none of them can be ordered and received yet, but i prefer to wait for one of these vs buying one of the products currently available.  flex and basis are due any time now, amiigo is due this summer. basis has the most sensors but is big and boxy looking so probably not what you are looking for.  flex is probably ideal (wristband, tracks sleep, not their first try at this), but the amiigo is going to have a 2nd tracker you put on your shoe in addition to the wristband which will track 100 specific exercises,  but i dont think amiigo is going to track sleep, at least i couldnt find it on their page.if you are planning to buy a galaxy s4 they are supposed to have a fitness wristband that will work with the health app.i also just downloaded the moves app for iOS and it is an ok way to track steps if you are going to wait for one of these new products."		"Most people i know are happy with polyurethane,refinishing-as is illustrated here at this old house: http://www.thisoldhouse.com"	"Most people i know are happy with polyurethane,refinishing-as is illustrated here at this old house: http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/m/article/0,,203303,00.html"		"There are quite a bunch of ways to share photos privately.

With this, you can choose to share with whomever you want. You can also write messages, share videos, and share calendars on this site. There is also PhotoBucket, DropShots, and PhotoRocket, among many others.You could also use one or more of the many file sharing apps out there, such as Google Drive, Box, DropBox. You just save or upload photos ( or any other types of files) to the service and allow sharing of folders with whomever you want. I have all three of these apps, but use Google Drive and DropBox the most. They all come with a few free GBs of storage space for free, and if you need more, you buy more. Google only charges $2.49 per month for 25 GB of storage. They have easy to use desktop clients as well and you can sync your files between devices. The desktop clients of these apps install a Windows a explorer type of interface....you click open the desktop app and navigate through your files as you would on a desktop drive.

Study the websites before you go to understand the highlights along the highway, near Hana and beyond.

LTE based 4G is much faster compared to WiMAX (the system you're currently using). these are the only 2 providers with widespread, nationwide LTE coverage at this time (Sprint and T-Mobile are only in a handful of cities for now). if it's available in your area, LTE speeds consistently reach 10Mbit/sec in solid coverage areas and can be as high as 50Mbit/sec with near ideal conditions (these speeds are between 5-20 times faster than your current solution).for example, i live in downtown Seattle and during peak hours i average 10-15Mbit/sec, off-peak hours i usually get around 35-40Mbit/sec on LTE.hopefully this will help give you another option."		"just one 'M' in SIM as it stands for Subscriber Identity Module."""						"and you're right, they can wear out. however, with regular u"""	"just one 'M' in SIM as it stands for Subscriber Identity Module."""					"and you're right, they can wear out. however, with regular usage (insert into device and leave it there) they usually don't for 99.996% of SIMs. but like any other solid-state memory, they are sensitive to stray electrons and magnetic fields, thus they're more likely to fail if reinserted a lot, subject to moisture while powered, the device it's in is defective, etc. "						"for anyone with reception issues, replacing the SIM card with a known good card is usually the first step in the troubleshooting flow chart.

We've decided to comb the web for some answers, and have found a few recommendations for a stylish and convertible crib-toddler bed that fits your needs.The Sorelle Princeton 4-in-1 convertible crib (http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3331891) is $399.99 and has a unique functional design that incorporates a crib, toddler bed, a full-sized bed, and even a drawer. This is definitely a long-term purchase. The downside is the cost, but it may be offset by not having to buy another bed for a few years. Babies R Us is offering an online-only offer for 15% off purchases over $125, so you could get it for around $340. (crib pictured below)The Graco Lauren Convertible Crib (http://www.gracobaby.com/Products/Pages/ProductDetails.aspx?ProductID=1375741) is $179.99 and comes in natural wood or a white or espresso color. Its design is fairly simplistic and no-frills, and it'll will convert into a toddler bed (no guard rail is needed for the conversion), daybed and full-size headboard (though you will need to get a bed frame and mattress). Graco also offers a 5-year limited warranty against manufacturer?s defects. The best part is that the crib is safety certified by the JPMA, ASTM, and CPSC (it?s very very safe!). The Stork Craft Tuscany 4-in-1 Stages Crib (http://www.amazon.com/Stork-Craft-Tuscany-Stages-Black/dp/B002BIDE3Y%3FSubscriptionId%3D19BAZMZQFZJ6G2QYGCG2%26tag%3Dsquid1205116-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB002BIDE3Y) from Stork Craft costs $279, but is $186.99 on Amazon. It?s a very stylish crib that will convert into everything you need ? and it meets/exceeds all of the US and Canadian safety standards. It also has a great look/finish and is less expensive than most other 4-in-1 cribs. That being said, it is made in China, so it may not be exactly what you?re looking for.Babycenter has a guide on some important safety notes and things to look for when buying a crib ? something to read over before you do go ahead and buy one:http://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-buy-a-crib_432.bcWe hope this helped you find a few potential cribs for your baby.

On Organic cow's milk - there are two types: ultrapasteurized and regular pasteurized.  Of course there's non-pasteurized or raw"", but I'm not going there.  Ultrapasteurized really nukes the crap out of the milk (which is why you can leave it out of the fridge and it doesn't spoil).  Regular pasteurized heats it enough to kill the most harmful bacteria, but still leaves some of the others in there.  The latter is the kind we buy because I wasn't sure I wanted that much done to my milk.  The thing to be careful of with the other milks is added sugar.  Some of the almond milks or other such will add sugar to make it taste good, so you're getting one benefit but at the cost of more sweetener.

It can stain teeth (my wife's are permanently stained from childhood Fluoride addition to her municipal water supply, and her thyroid is basically non-functional).  See http://thyroid.about.com/cs/relatedconditions/a/flushot.htm for example.Third, THM (tri-halo methanes).  Nasty byproducts of chlorinating water, these are highly reactive and can have a variety of ill health impacts.One possibility is to use RO (reverse osmosis) water, which removes just about everything, and does it close to on-demand at the sink.  There are several vendors who provide RO systems."		"I currently use Hemp Milk. http://www.livingharvest.com/products/milk I used to drink Raw Goat Milk.

It is a good place to eat, but we prefer to spend our time in the parks.We usually save Downtown Disney for a half day activity. For example, go to a smaller park like Animal Kingdom, in the morning , then spend the evening and dinner at Downtown Disney. On your last day, if you have a late flight out of town, you can make this your last stop of shopping.It also depends on the ages of the people in your group. Teens and young adults will find more to do in Downtown Disney more than will younger children. For example, the Disney Quest Indoor Theme Park is more for Teens and Tweens.

Liebherr refrigerator, and we?ve got some pros and cons for you to consider (taken with a grain of salt): Pros:-STYLING: The Liebherr?s unique styling sets it apart when compared to other refrigerators.-FEATURES: The Liebherr has a wine rack, icemaker (which similar products don?t have), and the option for a feature called BioFresh, which keeps your food fresher longer.-RELIABILITY: For the price you pay, the Liebherr is going to be a good long-term investment.Cons:-ICEMAKER: A few customers have had problems with the Liebherr's icemaker - as in it not working.-TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS: Some owners have experienced temperature fluctuations with their Liebherr, though this is supposedly just part of the defrosting cycle.-CLEANING PROBLEMS: Cleaning the stainless steel on the fridge seems like a problematic affair - you may need to do some digging if you want to find the perfect cleaning solution.-DOORSTOPS: The fridge doesn't have doorstops, so the doors will open up all the way - something to keep in mind if you do end up going with the fridge.-LIGHTING: The Liebherr?s lighting is not substantial in comparison to competitors, though this may not be a criteria for you.Similar Products:Fagor 24? Refrigerator (http://www.fagoramerica.com/appliances/refrigerators/integrated_24_inch_refrigerator)	-Better lighting (LED)	-Lower priced	-Doesn't come with ice makerHopefully this gave you some idea on what the Liebherr would be like in the real world.

I don?t use any games but I assume it would make a difference for her to have the faster device with the A6 chip. The taller screen would also make a difference for her use case as email, Facebook and games would all get an upgrade in screen real-estate. When I now pick up an older form factor iPhone the screen feels much smaller. I also really like that on landscape mode I can see the full week view of my calendar. Another feature I appreciate is having LTE, it makes a huge difference in wireless performance. The device is lighter and thinner. One down side on fit and finish is that I find iPhone 5 is easier to scratch with the metal back. And sides seem to be of a metal that is not as strong as the one Apple has used in iPhone 4. The lightning connector may be a bit annoying as accessories that one accumulates over the years will need adapters and/or upgrades ? but as a generational shift happens with iPhone?s iPad?s and iPod?s breaking with the older style connector may be best done now. All considered I would recommend the iPhone 5. Given she has been using 3GS until now it sounds like she sticks with the device for quite some time before upgrading, the new connector, the more powerful processor, the faster wireless and the screen makes me think she would enjoy going for the iPhone 5 if she will use it for ~3 years."		Because they are too long	Because they are too long		I need to elaborate for you on one point the person above touched on as it relates to the connector...ergo...the new 8-pin light	"I need to elaborate for you on one point the person above touched on as it relates to the connector...ergo...the new 8-pin lightning connector. It isn't just a shift, it lives up to its name - it truly does charge the phone faster. I've noticed the difference and its awesome, because time is important and it buys me just that. Also you can plug it in from either side, unlike the old 32 pin connector your wife has. May seem trivial, but it's a simple nice convenience we overlook and truly never really think about; however, that's what differentiates Apple from the rest - they think of what we need/want before we know we need or want it. :)"		@Ian is a huge believer of crossfit.

Organic produce prices are comparable between WF and PPC (both expensive), but you actually get a lot more from PCC because their products are sourced from the local farmers. This means you'll end up with organic produce that's not only high in quality but also very fresh, which is more than what you'll get from the WF's corporate non-local brands (I believe some of their organics are actually available at other grocery stores at cheaper prices).

The 301 has some GPS accuracy issues (particularly a long startup time), but I still run races with it from time to time. The 305 is probably my favorite and seems to be indestructible.With the 405 & later, they really made a design push to be more like watches you would wear all the time.

After *much* trial and error, starts and stops I've discovered the following (note tl;dr at bottom for a direct answer):0) The System is waaaay more important than the app. Have your system be driving  your app, not the other way around. Putting this at the top because its the most important part. 1) Nearly any system will work fine. The critical component is maintaining the system and always following it. You are a smart person, so the system is just an aid, not a personal secretary. On the flip side, if you don't follow your system, it makes no difference how good it is.  At any given stretch of time, you will have amazing powers of organization and follow through. Other times you will fight it and flail.   Whatever process you choose, it must support both when you rock and when you don't. To maintain doing a system, it needs to be simple to understand as well as easy and fun to use.  If it takes too long to input and organize an item, you will lose interest quickly, regardless of the benefit. 2) Project/Team/Business systems and apps are not likely to meet your personal to-do needs.   They are built with different users in mind and the complexity increases exponentially. Find a personal to-do manager. 3) Any app you choose must be ubiquitous to what you do naturally. If you sit at a desk most of the day, desktop/web software is fine. If you go to meetings or are on the road, it's important to have a mobile way of managing your items. If you're driving and something on the radio reminds you to call Josh, or a show you want to see, you need a way of entering it through voice.  A very important step is to get it out of your head and into your system ASAP. . You don't want to have to pay emotional rent to something that you don't need to.  This causes stress over time. 5) Have a goal when evaluating. Are you looking to build a single project or are you looking for an every day manager?tl;dr  I finally settled on Getting Things Done (GTD) as a system and Omnifocus as my core app. GTD emphasizes the need for a 'Reference' location to store things away from your desk. I use Evernote for digital things and a file cabinet for papers. I tried using Omnifocus without reading the book and it was OK, but see 'Part 0' at the top.  Once I developed the system, the app just fell into place.   Your mileage will vary and it's really a match of how you do things and your organizational strengths/weaknesses.

They have a few different Evernote apps as well, which can be integrated. A good one that I use a lot is the web clipper for Firefox, which lets you clip and save things you find on the web. Another that I haven't tried yet, but looks like a great idea, is Evernote Hello, which helps you to remember people that you meet. If you are someone that uses LinkedIn a lot, you can even link it to your LinkedIn profile. I really need to download this one since I'm so bad at remembering names. There are also some 3rd party developers that are creating apps to integrate with Evernote, so their ecosystem is growing quite nicely.

Here?re our conclusions:The D7000 and D7100 have substantial differences in their picture-taking abilities. More specifically, D7100 images are much easier to post-process, and the camera has better color accuracy and depth, as well as an AutoFocus (AF) module that is leagues better when compared to the D7000. A quote we found: ?In terms of image quality, I don't think the D7100, or even the D7200 [that doesn?t exist yet] will make sense to upgrade to for most D7000 owners.?Since you're not a D7000 owner though, you will find that the D7100 is amazing compared to your current camera. Here's a site that has visualistic comparisons between the two cameras - something to check out:http://snapsort.com/compare/Nikon-D7100-vs-Nikon_D7000The bottom line:If you?re willing to spend the extra money on the D7100, go for it. The quality of pictures you will take with the D7100 will surpass the D7000?s pictures. When/if you upgrade in the future, the D7100 will also net you a higher resale value than the D7000. However, if you will primarily use the DSLR to take video, the D7000 will suffice ? it?s not worth it to spend the extra $200. (Here's a video on the D7100's Movie Mode: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gbf-CDd-AY)We hope this helps you get a bearing between the D7000 and D7100 for your situation. Yabble on :-)!-Yabbly ConciergeP.S.A little nitpicky, but an issue that came up with Nikon DSLRs is that autofocusing while taking a video will be quite noisy:?This is a limitation of AF in video on all Nikon DSLR's. I generally only use AF to pre-focus before a shot and will track focus manually in video mode."					"To avoid this, you can use single AF in video and just manually activate the AF when you need it.

Most importantly, you want to make sure it's certified, licensed, accredited or whatever the standard is.  Usually, that takes care of the minimum requirements regarding the facility and the providers (infant to teacher ratio, emergency procedures, safety, cleanliness, etc).  You will learn the most by visiting and reaching out to other parents around you to see what people recommend.  Try and get some feedback from existing parents at any particular facility.  Sit down with the owner/administrator and take a tour.  Look at the classrooms in action to see the size, how they are interacting with the children, the noise levels, interactions with older kids, cleanliness, staffing, etc.Ask every single question that pops into mind.  Don't worry - they are used to fielding those types of questions.  Everything from scheduled diaper changes (how often? minimum schedule?) to feedings (when, where, what, how much? what if baby won't eat?  what if baby eats all the food early?) to napping (scheduled naps?  do they rock them or just put them down?) to interactive/playtime (who interacts? what toys? do they teach sign language to help communicate? what other things do they do/teach?).   Special needs or instructions and how they deal with those?Dig in a bit about the care providers, their backgrounds and experience.  Figure out their schedules and if they rotate providers during day or do they work staggered schedules or are they there all day long.  Most places do, but just ensure everyone is CPR certified (and infant CPR certified).  Discuss their emergency preparedness plans (disasters/emergencies - where do they go? how do they contact you?), schedules (inclement weather or winter/spring breaks - if it is a center that has older kids as well, often times they have scheduled breaks).  Sick kid policy, allergies, etc etc...

If you have faulty hardware, you'll know it immediately and it will be covered in the default warranty.  Otherwise, it is an issue that will happen much later (usually a hard drive failure well after the default warranty expires). AppleCare shines with its coverage though. It will cover other apple wifi base stations, SuperDrives, power chords and external displays for three years (though they each have default warranties too). I've had one incident in the last 8 years that required AppleCare.  My secondary display was a *little* wonky (very slight waviness) so I took it in and they replaced it no questions asked because I had coverage on my Mac. Also keep in mind that any software problem you have will likely be addressed at the Genius Bar for free without even asking if you have AppleCare. I'd imagine this is the biggest probability. In the end, this is insurance. Do the math. Is the $ risk amount exceeding the cost of the coverage and the probability it will happen?Use an example of a hard drive failure. Is the cost of replacing it more than $250?  What is the probability it will happen within 3 years?  If the cost is more and the probability high, then get the extended warranty. Otherwise skip it. (Also keep in mind the other possible failures and costs too). Tl;dr: get it on the Mac if you have other apple products that are covered by that Mac's AppleCare.  Otherwise skip it. Coverage explained here:http://www.apple.com/support/products/mac.htmlThe coverage is explained here: http://wwwhtml"		steak	steak		"OK, I just spent like an hour trying to cross check three sites to find one that satisfied Stella's organic no-toxin site, Consu"	"OK, I just spent like an hour trying to cross check three sites to find one that satisfied Stella's organic no-toxin site, Consumer Reports testing of actual UV protection (note they only tested 12 types so it could be that others are better but they just didn't test), and finally scanning Amazon user reviews.

Decide if you want in-home care (usually a Mom doing daycare on the side - cheaper if she's sick or on vacation then the daycare is closed) or a facility. For a facility, find out how long the teachers have been there - daycares have high turnover in general, but it's a big adjustment for you and the child when teachers change in the middle of the year, and a good signal when teachers stay. Make sure there's a match between your parenting preferences and what the daycare provider is willing to do - e.g. if your child has unique feeding or napping schedule, will they be able to accommodate that. Taking care of infants is pretty basic, so you don't have to worry much about teaching philosophy and such at that age, but if there's a preschool at the center too, see if their philosophy matches what you want, because once they're at a place they're more likely to stay there longer term due to difficulty switching providers with wait lists and such.In Seattle, I believe infant care at a center was $1500-$2000 per month.

I spent a few days at a Jungle Lodge where I met a few other solo travelers - family style eating at night and group adventures during the day made it fun.

If we'd stayed down a bit longer, carbon monoxide likely would have killed us both due to the elevated partial pressure.

I'll answer from my personal position, which may well not overlap with others.First, the Macs.  (Warning, this paragraph is high geek factor.)  I started using Unix back around Berkeley 4.0 through 4.3, and compared to ATT System 3 & System 5, BSD was absolutely my favorite.  I still use OpenBSD a lot, I greatly prefer it to Linux, HP/UX, AIX, etc. when I have a choice.  Thus when Mac went from MacOS to OS/X I took a look at them - I never actually used a Mac running MacOS.  But OS/X is based on BSD; I can single-user boot any OS/X machine and get full control.  I can SSH to it, use terminal on it, that's a degree of control that's difficult to impossible with Windows.Second, the iPhone.  I have both iPhone and Galaxy S3.  The 5 is just completely intuitive to me.  A phone for me needs to be a highly reliable appliance that takes as few brain cycles related to it compared to getting something done.  Android, for me, requires more thinking about it in order to get something done.  So the 5 wins just for ease of use."		"Whatever you get, I would opt for whatever is the least processed, preferably from a local farm.

The staff was friendly and helpful, the rooms were beautifully appointed and all of the restaurants were fantastic with a great variety, I think 9 restaurants total on the grounds.They have numerous pools each with their own sort of personality, if you wanted something a little more lively you could hang out at the main pool/pool bar, if you wanted a secluded pool for relaxing there were several there as well.Nightly entertainment was great and the beach was very nice, they also have a full service spa, which we didn't take advantage of, but heard great things about.The best part IMHO was the other clientelle. It was a range of people, almost all couples, between late 20's to early 50's, from across the US along with quite a few folks from the UK.

The verdict? Get the Roku 3. Here?s a comparison between the two:Roku 3+Interface customization (move channels, interface themes)+Multi-content search function that will list price of content across different channels+The MicroSD slot and USB port can be used to import your own content (plus it plays video files in multiple formats)+New remote w/ audio jack for private listening+Remote doubles as motion controller-Doesn?t play very well with the Apple ecosystem-No dedicated YouTube app-Roku smartphone app can only push music/photos stored on phone to TV-Onscreen keyboard isn?t amazingApple TV+Shines if you're an avid Apple/AirPlay user+Has YouTube+Easy-to-use, uncluttered interface (as we should expect from an Apple product)+AirPlay streaming support + screen mirroring+Access to iTunes store/library-Little to no interface customization options -No search across multiple content sources-USB port doesn't support all types of contentHere?s the bottom line: the Roku 3 offers a better interface, search function, remote, and content sources. However, if you?re an avid user of AirPlay and Apple devices, you?re going to find that the Roku is a little weak in providing for these. It?s not a huge problem, and you can use the Roku smartphone app to send music from your phone?s iTunes library over to the box, but it won?t be the greatest experience. Here're some videos to check out:CNET Prizefight - AppleTV vs. Rokuhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sToSy_-Zk4Roku Interface Walkthroughhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=iY2xMW1vbfY#at=15We hope this helped.

The name comes from the lack of a mirror for shooting the image that allows both the camera bodies and the interchangeable lenses to be much smaller.When I made the jump to a more serious camera (and especially the flexibility of interchangeable lenses), I looked at many systems but eventually settled on micro four/thirds.  Their lens selection is the largest of all the mirrorless systems (dwarfing competitor Sony's NEX, Samsung's NX systems, and Fujifilm's X systems).A great article on which camera to buy (with different choices at various price points) is on one of my favorite sites, Wirecutter:http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-mirrorless-camera-over-1000/"		"Rent before you buy.

As you might guess, in a seller's market, I did quite well selling myself. The hard part is that you get a lot of lookers, so screening for qualified buyers is important, and that's what traditional agents do. In a buyer's market, and in depressed times when I thought I wouldn't be able to sell my home, I sold with a traditional agent, but here's the tip I learned: there are only a handful of agents in your community -- sometimes as few as 2 or 3 -- that are selling the most (as much as 80%). These are uber connected agents that really know how to sell! So, in tough times, I've asked around to find out who these agents are, and then land with one, and I've never been disappointed. You make more selling yourself or through some of the alternative methods out there, but a really effective traditional agent will get it done quickly for you in a slow market. That's my experience."		I know you said you briefly looked into recording TV with a computer.

The MythTV project (http://www.mythtv.org/) has been around forever and I used it years back when it was much less developed and it was still a breeze. You have to make sure to get the right kind of hardware (i.e., linux compatible TV tuner, etc). But the overall requirements are pretty low and any old PC with a few upgrades can likely handle TV recording quite well (depending on your HD needs). They even have pre-made full OS distributions with MythTV already installed. (http://www.mythbuntu.org/)If you're in for a fun project that will end with an awesome DVR, I can't recommend Myth enough. Check out the wiki at (http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/MythTV-HOWTO#First_things_first) and give it a read. Might a bit complex but if you do a little bit of homework, it isn't terribly hard to grok.Anyways, I know its a bit more on the technical side, but as I mentioned, maybe you can see it as a fun learning project with the added benefit of building your own technology that does exactly what you want it to :)"		kindle!	kindle!		Sonia u need to agree w my answer above.

I had to host my own open house, and they were being cease-and-desisted by Windermere for allegedly misappropriating the local MLS. Their agent assignment was really poor. My agent went on vacation without notice and left me hanging, I had to call the office blind to get help from someone.That said, I see a lot of good improvements. My advice would be to get a good referral from someone without skin in the game (sorry @Marita). If someone got great service from a specific agent, use that same agent.Also, and this is probably more important than any other choice you make, develop a criteria for what you need in an agent. The acts of listing vs selling a house are two very different things. Listing is basically adding a house to the MLS and waiting for someone to notice it. Selling involves staging, open houses, advertising, all of which imply using a portion of the commission on the act of selling. Since all agents charge roughly the same, good support from an agent isn't necessarily an assumption."		"I like drinking tap water. It's like being one with the earth for me, at the city level.

One creative alternative is to use the annual gifting amount per spouse/per child (approx $13K) and use that toward the premium for life insurance on the child (i believe it's whole term, the kind which the premium is fixed for 10 or 20 years).  Sounds weird to take out life insurance on a child but you lock in a good premium, can borrow/draw against the death benefit for not just college, and the benefit is a protected asset.  Choose a good mutual company insurance provider (Guardian, Mass mutual, etc) and they usually provide about 3-4% guaranteed annual growth.

Credit unions, at least in my opinion, are the best places to do your banking. They generally offer lower interest rates on most services. For example, lower interest rates on credit cards, car loans, mortgages, personal loans, etc...They usually also charge lower fees (sometimes no fees) for account services, such as ATM withdrawal fees, minimum balance fees, etc.Put some money into accounts for a while to establish yourself, then open a secured card, if you are not able to open a regular credit card. Usually you would have to put an amount of money into the account that's attached to the secured card, and that would be your credit limit. After establishing a good payment history, the credit union (or bank) should let you open a regular card account. There are many credit unions out there. I had availability to one through my job. That one is out of state for me, however, I do my banking with them online. I have no problem doing online banking, but I'm not sure if you would be comfortable doing so.. If you are, then that expands your options as to what credit unions are available. There is a government website called www.NCUA.gov where you can search for local credit unions or do an advanced search to see if you might qualify to join any specific credit unions. If you go to this site, go to: http://researchcu.ncua.gov/Views/FindCreditUnions.aspx You search by area code, name, type, region, There is a dropdown called Field of Membership"" where you can find different types of credit unions. Generally to join a credit union, you have to be part of some certain group. For example, if you belong to a certain church, business, organization, military, or other group.

From our research, we discovered that there?s some competition between Milwaukee portabands and DeWalt portabands, but we also found out that people seem to be loving their DeWalt a lot more. Here?s a general comparison (we?ll leave it to you to find the best model that best fits your needs):DeWalt Portable Band Saws:+Higher quality+More compact+Built in LED light+Rubber bumpers (better rubber fall protection)+Costs less than a Milwaukee+Hanging hookMilwaukee Portable Band Saws	+Greater power compared to similar DeWalt portabands+Better suited and hold up better in work environmentsHere?s a quote we saw on an online board regarding this topic, it may help sum it up: ?Dewalt is like the Chevy, better ergonomics, lighter weight, smother fit and finish.Milwaukee is like the Ford, a bit more rugged, clunker and you are going to find more of them out on the job site.?Beyond these two brands, here are two other options for you. Porter Cable 9750 Variable Angle Reciprocating SawThe Porter Cable is a reciprocating saw that has variable angle functionality. The blade end rotates 360 degrees with 12 angle stops and the forward section swivels 180 degrees up and down with 13 angle stops. Quite nifty, but also quite heavy for a portable saw (according to reviewers).http://www.amazon.com/Porter-Cable-9750-Tiger-Reciprocating-Variable/dp/B0000ASDMKHarbor Freight Portable Band Saw If you're looking for a less-name brand, lower-priced saw, check out the Harbor Freight. It's definitely no DeWalt or Milwaukee, but it'll get the job done (not as well though).http://www.harborfreight.com/portable-variable-speed-bandsaw-47840.htmlWe hope this helped you a little bit in your search for a new portable band saw. All signs point to the DeWalt as a better tool, but we'll leave it to you to make the decision. Let us know which one you end up going with.

Do you want advice on picking between the two races, or are you curious about trying to run both races?If you're wondering about doing both, I'd point out that 5 weeks prior to a race is typically your last week of really hard work before you being tapering off to [ideally] peak on your race date.If you're an experienced runner, I'd say that there's enough time between the two races to push it pretty hard in the 12k and still have more than enough time to recover/expect a good showing in the half marathon.If you're not as experienced, and your training plan has been working for you, then I'd caution to stick to your original plan.If you're trying to pick between the 12k and 13.1 distance, my personal pick would be the 12k. I focus on 10ks because due to work, kids, etc, I just don't really have the time to properly train for a half or full marathon.10ks & 12ks are awesome because you can typically fit more than adequate training (for the distance) in a rather concise block of time."		"Here are a couple of ideas:-Triscuits with Salami-Carob Nuggets, available in bulk section of most grocers-Tamari Almonds"	"Here are a couple of ideas:-Triscuits with Salami-Carob Nuggets, available in bulk section of most grocers-Tamari Almonds-Sahale snacks are great but priceyI also recommend making your own energy bars using an assortment of dried fruits/nuts that are held together using arrowroot powder and brown rice syrup.

Two of the times I went solo, the third time I went with my husband.I have a friend who was going for 2 weeks and here's the advice I gave them... in several parts:The North: Chang Mai    Chang Mai --        Definitely elephant trek -- They're all pretty much the exact same and I'd trust your hotel to set one up for you. They usually come pick you up in a van and bring you to the trek, feed you, and then bring you back at the end of the day.        Night Market -- If you just say Night Market, everyone knows what it is and where it is. It's HUGE and there's so many cool things to buy that are cheap. And if my memory serves me correctly, it was a bit cheaper than some of the other night markets/bazaars in Bangkok.  I bought hand-made silverware that I still use to this day and it still looks brand spankin' new and it was significantly cheaper in Chang Mai.        Since you have so many days in Chang Mai, I'd take a cooking class somewhere.I'm a beach person - so for me 6 days in Chang Mai would be too many days since there's not THAT much to do up there unless you go check out Pai and Chang Rai -- but both cities there's about the same amount of things to do."		"If it were up to me, I'd bring Chang Mai down to 3-4 days and increase the amount of days you're in the southern portion -- you'"	"If it were up to me, I'd bring Chang Mai down to 3-4 days and increase the amount of days you're in the southern portion -- you'll find a week at the beach down south won't be nearly enough.  Especially because there are so many islands around there -- Railay is worth checking out if you're staying in Phi Phi - one of the more gorgeous places we visited.  Beaches aren't AS quiet... but it's still pretty ridiculous. Check out my links below.If you like snorkeling, beaches and relaxing, Phuket and Phi Phi will keep you busy for weeks.  Down there you can rent mopeds (or an actual car for ridiculously cheap) and make your way around from beach to beach. We loved the beach Nai Har on Phuket (link below) - just really gorgeous and not many people. The beaches are all accessible by car or motorbike and I highly recommend you rent one for the entire trip. It's like 6 bucks a day if I can remember correctly and you can find them by just driving around on a moped to see if someone has a car for rent outside their house. It's legit if you can believe it and suppper nice people. super nice. just be careful on the motorbikes. everyone crashes them b/c they go too fast."		"** Phuket - http://www.phuket.com -- is very pretty, there's a ton to see, it's close to all the other islands that are cool (li"	"** Phuket - http://www.phuket.com -- is very pretty, there's a ton to see, it's close to all the other islands that are cool (like Koh Phi Phi, Railay, Krabi).        Patong is where all the action is and is the busiest part of the island - I wouldn't stay here, but I would go there for a day to check out the shops and the beaches.

It is increasingly becoming very popular for tourists who wish to escape the crowds.My husband and I went there 2 years ago. It was one of the most memorable beach vacations we've had. We stayed at the Blue Wind Resort. Small hut bungalow, air-coned, clean bathroom and well-kept surrounding. A 30sec walk to the beach. Quiet by day and night. The loud evening entertainment was hardly audible from where we stayed.The Sairee Beach is the longest and most popular beach on the island. And because of it's length, the privacy is great too.The water is clear and beautiful by day.When the sun sets, outdoor dining and fire show emerging and lights up the coast line. It is probably the busiest it can get. And if you like the bustle, the BBQ seafood here is superb and really value for money for it's freshness and size. For quiet dinner, head over to Rim Lae Restaurant( part of Cabana Resort) which is a 12 min beach-walk for BBQ stuff, thai food and cocktail. It is slightly high end but the atmosphere definitely make up for it. The restaurant is set overlooking the bay. We went there 2 times for both afternoon cocktail and BBQ dinner. There are many resorts to choose from. We went with Blue Wind because our friend works there.

Then we tend to compare packages and prices when we come across tour agencies in town.Our snorkeling trip consisted of 5 snorkeling sites,  equipments and lunch at about $1000baht. Overall, very enjoyable experience, as promised.A must-visit is the Nang Yuen island. A very lovely island not to be missed. Picturesque and beautiful. Very few people know about this secret island. It is a short distance away from Koh Tao. A private island which emphasizes on friendly environment, no plastic water bottle allowed. Visitors must wash their feet before and after they leave the beach. The water is almost transparent with many small fish swimming around. You can walk into the sea. Perfect for snorkeling.And if it's not entirely an island trip, Bangkok is another good choice- only if your daughter is not too little. 1. Platinum Shopping MallThis is a heaven for crazy and cheap shopping. You will find wholesale latest fashion, kids', menswear,accessories etc at very good bargains. Not necessary to buy in wholesale though, it is just a wholesale marketplace for business owners. Bargaining not appreciated( according to my thai husband) but being Singaporean, we just love trying our luck. Shops open from 10am by 7pm.2. Jatuchuk Weekend Market- aka JJ MarketTo pick up some unique and local-designed pieces. Clothes, pets, shoes, art work, food stores. You need it, they have it. Home and decor stuff are known to be the cheapest here. Endless of mini stores tucked in the tiny lanes. You will need at least half a day here. It can get really hot in between the small lanes. The whole of JJ market is like a huge maze and it can get really hot, therefore I do not recommended parents bringing their young kids here. When I saw many foreigner parents carrying the kids in their arms, I empathize both the little ones and the parents. Shops open from 10am to 6pm."		Thx Tom!! Super helpful =)	Thx Tom!!

We love Amazon - we have Prime and pretty much order everything from there and often... HOWEVER the baby registry I very much regret using because their return policy is AWFUL. even tho it says you can rerun as easily as you would if you bought something yourself, that is not the case. If someone buys something that is fulfilled by Amazon, you can return it yourself, and even if you specify exactly which item to get from exactly which store on amazon, we found our gift givers searched high and wide for the best price (naturally, right?). What that resulted in us having to go back and forth with the non-amazon store who sold thru amazon and they couldn't give us a refund, only a store credit to their store, which happened to carry nothing of what we'd want. Shipping cost was also an issue bc again unless it was fulfilled by amazon it wasn't free reruns. We lost $80 on a stroller bc we decided we didn't want it after we tried it and the store would only take it back if we paid for return shipping. "		"@Andy-friendly, what is performance"" for you?

I ordered brand new sneakers and received a pair of filthy, used sneakers! The company expected ME to return them at my expense ( I don't think so!!! ). I did end up contacting Amazon for help after several attempts to resolve it through the 3rd party. After I gave them an awful review and contacted Amazon to see if they could help in some way, suddenly the 3rd party store got back to me and ended up crediting the shoes.

We decided to look into this for you and have come up with 2 reasonably priced options for 70-inch HDTVs. Our Pick:The Vizio Razor 70 LED E701i 1080p (http://store.vizio.com/e701ia3.html) is abut $1,700, which is a great price for such a large name-brand TV. It has all the bells and whistles you?d expect (even the one you may not want, Smart TV) ? it's an LED TV, it has 4 HDMI inputs, it has USB inputs, and it is 120Hz (not the greatest, but not the worst). Vizio is not known for the best reliability ? but the warranty should cover any out-of-box problems. (You should also know that CNET calls the Vizio E701i the Best 70-inch LED TV value - just something to keep in mind!)"					Great Second Option:			"The Sharp Aquos 70? TV line also seems to be another line of great value TVs which you can find for around $2,000-$3,000. Specifically, the Sharp Aquos Quattron LC-70LE733U TV (http://reviews.cnet.com/flat-panel-tvs/sharp-aquos-quattron-lc/4505-6482_7-34851078.html) received CNET?s Green Pick award, so you?ll be using less energy when you run it (always a plus). It runs at 240Hz, and also has 4 HDMI ports, and includes the extra bells and whistles (Wi-Fi connectivity, Smart system). The benefit this TV has over the Vizio is that its 240Hz refresh rate means that it may run a bit better in clarity, though you?re paying extra for it. Generally, the Sharp Aquos line is one to consider, even if you?re looking at non-2013 model year TVs. A great secondary option to the Vizio Razor depending on where your preference and price range lies."						"Though you don't want Smart TVs, these both will give you a run for your money.

Also keep in mind these are all Smart TVs, if you're okay with having the features but opt not to use them. I personally find that it's becoming increasingly harder to find a big high-performance TV that doesn't have any Smart features.In terms of performance, what I usually look for in a flatscreen are viewing angles (how much they affect the TV's picture quality) plus the level of blacks, resolution and sharpness of the picture. Everything else can be calibrated to your liking (colors, removing soap-opera effect, etc). If these are product aspects that you care about, then Sharp LC-70LE640U and the Sharp recommended above by YB Concierge actually performs extremely well in the aforementioned areas. You also typically get a lot of HDMI ports with Sharp (4 slots), plus the pricing is usually below $2500. Right after Sharp, I'd personally consider a 70-inch Samsung LED. However, as much as I love my recently purchased Samsung Smart TV (55 inch), I do have to admit it's extremely pricey (starting @ $6000) when you're considering one at 70 inch. You also may want to pay attention to whether a TV is an Edge-Lit or Backlit LED with local dimming. Typically Edge-Lit TVs (most common type) are extremely susceptible to clouding effects when you're watching in a dark room (http://guide2lcdtv.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/clouding.jpg) and also screen uniformity issues (things are brighter on the edge of the screen) while Backlit LED TVs do not have these problems. All Samsungs are victims of this problem, and it took me a long while to get used to it with my current Sammy. If I were to purchase my next TV, I'd make it a Backlit with local dimming a top feature to have."		"@Tom, just visited it, but did not pay.  It is excellent. Very well managed and presented.

Smooth, great exercise programs (hill, random, etc that changes resistance and sets duration), and low maintenance. Essentially, we just need to dust it of pet hair from time to time. If you're able to invest in a better machine, it is definitely worth the money in quality of workout and how many years it will last overall. For features I'd recommend one with moving arms, *not* stationary arms. You get a better workout. I do use heart rate monitoring, but this is easy to find nowadays on other gadgets so not worth being built in. If you have the chance, may be worth doing a free gym trial or two to try the different machines/brands/features to give you a comparison between models - may help you decide on what calibre of machine to invest in, and what features are important to you.Good luck!"		"If you decide to seek out a diy template, the organization SCORE has one on their website (score.org).

It has the ability to print from just about anything, and it does include AirPrint (as well Google Cloud print, wi-fi printing, and Pixma cloud print). This printer has just about everything imaginable. It prints photos VERY quickly and the photo quality is outstanding - I am not a photographer, nor very familiar with photography, but as an average person, the photos look great. It has 6 individual ink tanks, which I love, so that you only have to change one color of ink at a time. It also has a memory card reader, double-sided printing, scanning, and you can even scan slides & negatives into it for saving or printing. If  you also have a Canon camera, there's this really cool feature where you can print still photos from a movie you filmed on that camera. The only thing it doesn't have is a fax. This may be a dealbreaker if you use a fax a lot. I personally only use a fax when job hunting and for very few other occasions. When I need to use a fax, I just use FreeFax online. Many years ago, I used to buy HP Printers, but every one I owned only lasted about a year or so. Something always ended up breaking down so that it would no longer print. I got sick of buying a new printer every year, so I read rave reviews about Canon printers, and bought one. I can't even remember how old my first Canon is, but I still have it and it still works, however I did buy the MG8220 late last year just to get updated features. Canon inks DO cost more, though, so that is something to take into consideration. However, in my opinion, the ink cost is worth the price. I usually stock up on my inks when I find a good sale. Sometimes NewEgg has big ink discounts on Black Friday, so I tend buy a bunch then."		Thank you everyone! I think I may at least try the free trial of Lynda.com.

It's a nice, thick cable, though not super thick and seems very sturdy. I had read reviews about other brands being flimsy or not being able to charge as fast as with the OEM sync cable. I do not see any difference in charging time using the Amazon extension cable and it's long enough for me to plug in and use while in bed, which is what I wanted. Both ends of the Amazon cable fit perfectly inside the ends of the iPad's sync cable and charger. It's a snug connection, so the connections won't come apart easily like if you accidentally tug the cable."		"I have an Android phone and absolutely love it, though I would probably love an iPhone just as much.

What I do like about Android is that there are more customizing options, plus I do use many Google services such as GMail, Google Drive, Google+, etc. For me, the main reason I went with an Android phone over iPhone was screen size. I do A LOT of web browsing and shopping with my phone, and I felt that the iPhone screen was too small. I had purchased the Samsung Galaxy Nexus when it first came out because it was the largest screen size available at that time (if I remember correctly). Now there are even larger screens available and upcoming, and I definitely want to get a larger one as my next phone. I'm female and always carry a handbag, so size doesn't matter to me. I don't have to carry it in my pocketI like my screen as large as possible. There are some shopping apps where you can't even pinch to zoom the images, not sure why, so it helps to have a larger screen to see the product images. I also like a larger screen for use with GPS apps.I can't compare iPhone to Android since I don't have an iPhone; however, I have an iPad, so I'm sure it's a very similar experience. I personally find both operating systems easy to use and learn. Another thing I like about Android is the ability to use custom home screens (Launchers). I use one called SPD Shell 3D and it adds a 3D look as well as tons of customizing options for your home screen. If you buy a Google phone directly from Google (such as the Nexus 4), the price is unbeatable and the phone is unlocked, which means you can use it on other carriers. The downside, though, is that it doesn't fully support 4G LTE speeds."		"Thanks Jim.

We?ve come up with a few resources for you that will help you on your search for an awesome new squash racket. Since you?re an advanced player, we?ll leave it to you to choose which racket best fits your needs for price, weight, and control, but we've also picked a racket which we think could be right for you!Our pick:Dunlop Aerogel seriesDunlop?s Aerogel squash rackets are all made with ?Aerogel Carbon Graphite? construction, which supposedly incorporates the world?s lightest solid and has a strength up to 4000 times its own weight. Every racket in this lineup is light, and their focus is to maximize power while also allowing great control. Dunlop has a bunch of different types of Aerogel rackets, and our recommendation is to look at the Dunlop Aerogel 4D Max ? it?s not too pricy yet offers everything you?re looking for.Beyond this recommendation, we know that every player has their own racket preference and needs. Check out this website which rates 2012-2013 squash rackets based on these preferences (such as durability, manufacturer, best value, court control):http://www.squashgalaxy.com/SG/category/racquetratings.htmlAnother cool resource is SquashHero, which presents you with a list of rackets based on the type of racket you?re interested in and your budget. The list also includes the pros and cons of each racket, so you know exactly what?s great or what?s missing:http://squashhero.com/explore/best-control-racketYou have a lot of options to choose from, but hopefully we've helped you narrow it down a little.

I bought one for my niece when she was two, and she absolutely loves it. She has use of an iPad now, but still likes to play with her LeapPad since it's her own tablet. It's very easy to use, though regular tablets and iPods are pretty easy to use as well. The only drawback for LeapFrog products are the price. I think the LeapPad's price has gone down over the past few years, so that isn't too bad, but the games are expensive. The game selection is quite limited as well. I always find games when they are on sale at Amazon or elsewhere.The games are on memory cards which have to be inserted into the LeapPad, so these can be lost very easily. I think there are more activities that can be done one LeapFrog's website as well. What I do like about the games is that they are all educational, they all teach something, whether it be motor skills, counting, or reading. If the child is too young to read, the tablet can read stories to them while the child watches a video of the story. My niece got hers a couple years ago and it still works fine, even after being dropped and sat on. It's built specifically for kid's use. You could also consider a Kindle Fire tablet or a Google Nexus 7 tablet and just get a good case for it. You can get the original Kindle Fire for just $159 on Amazon (8GB) or the Nexus 7 (16GB) directly from Google for $199.  (The Kindle Fire is much heavier and bulkier than the Nexus, though) There aren't as many apps/games as there are in Google's app store, but there are still tons of them. You can get games on Amazon's and Google's app stores for much cheaper or even for free. Both of them also have tons of games, books, learning apps for kids. As long as you have a decent case, it should protect the tablet from drops."		"Also, most regular tablets these days have either built-in parental controls, or apps that allow you to control your child's act"	"Also, most regular tablets these days have either built-in parental controls, or apps that allow you to control your child's activities.

As far as model selection of the LeapPad, there are only two, and the options are only between colors - pink or green. Also, I think there are other games on LeapFrog's website that kids can play to their LeapPad, however, they don't actually download onto the LeapPad. However, they do have a memory card available to purchase (very expensive as well considering you can get a much larger capacity standard memory card for WAYYY less, but the LeapPad uses a much larger & thicker memory card that is proprietary, meaning you can only use theirs in the LeapPad, not just any brand memory card.

If it's on a pole or tree, they will find a way to climb, but you can mount it under a soffit on your house or hang it from somewhere impossible to reach.Shop around for specialized bird feeders that make rodents' attempts futile. It's really easy to find specific feeders that have steep-sloped access, so only hovering birds can find their way to the food. Something else to consider is that birds will drop some of the seeds, and that will bring the rodents to your patio/garden/etc.If all else fails, you can get a cat or sprinkle your yard with predator pee.

Android is definitely better now than it was when I abandoned it, but I would not go back.The asset to Android is that you have a much better opportunity to customize your phone. The overall platform is far more open, and there are apps to change things that you just have to live with on iPhone (like the clock, the phone UI, text messages, web browsing, etc).If, however, you just want to pull a phone out of the box and start using it, the iPhone beats everybody."		"I wanted to switch to TweetDeck, but there are a couple reasons I haven't made the switch yet (although I may be missing feature"	"I wanted to switch to TweetDeck, but there are a couple reasons I haven't made the switch yet (although I may be missing features on TweetDeck after my brief trial!) As far as I can tell, it lacks some features I need. For example, managing Facebook Pages - I have a number of those, and I didn't find a way to add a Page stream in TweetDeck. That could be the main deal breaker for me switching over to TweetDeck. I have very little activity on G+ or LinkedIn streams, but if you do then there wouldn't be a way to manage that in TweetDeck. I don't monitor the other social networks that HootSuite supports, so that's a non-issue for me! Then there's the hootlet button. Although it's a good idea to customize your messages based on where they are going to, even across the same audience, I find it handy for certain posts that are appropriate for multiple accounts. I'd miss that if I switched.HootSuite is very clunky, but I suppose I'm fairly used to the UI now and do like being able to add tabs with multiple streams (which sadly, I've managed to max out). I can order my tabs based on how often I use them, and have certain tabs dedicated to multiple related searches. This works well for me because I manage activity in very different realms (tech, dogs, sewing!)  If you don't need to do this, TweetDeck would be preferable with the nice and simple column layout. But there's no way I could replicate the number of tabs/streams from HootSuite in TweetDeck and remain sane.I definitely agree that HootSuite needs a UI overhaul, especially as it is a paid service...There are a few other free options out there, such as GrabInbox."		I'd suggest going somewhere that has a wide selection and friendly staff that will let you try it out on a tester bike.

If the property owner wants to be a pain about the damage deposit they can fairly easily fabricate a claim and make things difficult.I've had two great experiences with a property in Lake Chelan and one lousy experience with a property in Arizona. The owner of the AZ property misrepresented the quality of the house and the furnishings to some degree, but my family rolls with it so that wasn't a deal breaker. The place was clean and it's really about the location.The problem arose when, after we'd returned home, he sends me an email full of fuzzy photos of alleged damage to a couple pieces of furniture and a picture frame. In the email he tells me he will have to send the stuff out to a furniture repair shop for an estimate.Conceptually, that sounds reasonable except that being respectful of, and careful with other people's property is a family value we actively teach our kids. And more to the point, the home was furnished top to bottom with WalMart rejects that looked like they'd been delivered to the house in a dump truck. It would have taken hours to catalog every nick and scratch when we first arrived.I never could get him to respond with his repair estimate and in the end I just let it go. It's one of those situations where I could have fought the guy, but it would have been time consuming and extremely contentious. I was satisfied knowing he was a jerk with horrific taste in furniture."		Android vs iPhone is essentially the same debate as Windows vs. Mac.

The type of deck (in my opinion) is arbitrary as long as it has Bluetooth. What's a must is getting the optional plug in microphone option. It makes most if not all of the road noise the people on the other end of the line hear. A cool and unexpected byproduct is that I can play songs from my iPhone over the Bluetooth and control my phone from the buttons on my Stereo. Most if not all companies that sell car stereos offer FREE installation. May not be what you were looking for but it's worked awesome for me and with out a doubt I'd do it again.

Once he can ride and is showing interest in going longer distances or on trails then I'd invest in a Trek or a Specialized.  We have both, I think we like the Trek marginally better.  We have bikes in all sizes, but each size only seems to get used for a year or at most a year/half until they move up to the next size, especially boys who get big fast during that age range.We tried the scoot bike for my youngest and he didn't want anything to do with it because it didn't look like the big kids' bikes.

Our issues are actually related to the particular mgmt company on site that may handle guest relations.  We appreciate the comments on Airbnb and will look into it, so thank you Yabbly :-).  In response to @seattle-chase, sorry that happened to you.  We had the opposite happen where guests have damaged furniture, broken appliances, and stolen playstation games/dvd movies, but because the mgmt company did not realize immediately, we never charged the guests.  Nor did we want to accuse any guests.  Also, VRBO does have traveler's review section where you can see others' experiences.  So that can help you with determining your rental but from an owner's perspective it can possibly work against you as you want a good review and therefore may not want to pursue damage claims against former guests for fear they will badmouth your place.

A lot of baby accessories (swing, bouncy chair, exersaucers, high chairs) are easy enough to sanitize the plastic parts and have removable covers that can be washed and dried. So as long as they aren't broken or too used, you can find some great deals on only slightly used baby gear.Things I would not buy used: anything I cannot clean or sanitize well (Mattresses, boppy pillow, etc). Personally, I wouldn't buy a used breast pump, but I know people who have and don't have any issue with it. And I wouldn't buy a used car seat. Even if it looks pristine, there's really no way of knowing it's treatment, and if it's safety has been compromised in any way. Hope that helps! "		@tedb have a 240v outlet in the garage (same as washer/dryer) that delivers 30 miles per hour of charge.

I guess if you never owned an iPad, the Mini would be fine, but if you had the iPad first, and then go to Mini, I am not so sure.  I find myself partial to iPad for sure.  I pick up the Mini now when I forget to charge my iPad.  True statement.  Just my experience."		Ooh. I feel like the retina display makes a difference.

Might be worth just going to the store and compare them side-by-side to see if you can live without retina."		Half Moon Bay is nice.

I've been there 2 or 3 times and never been disappointed.One thing that hasn't been mentioned in barbecue. Atlanta has some great choices, but I think two of the best are Fat Matt's and Heirloom Market Barbecue. Both are sort of hole in the wall places, a little crowded and limited seatings. But, in some ways, that is the charm too and they are crowded because it is so good.South City Kitchen, where I ate tonight actually, is great too. Higher end southern food.

First, for the most powerful machines, you'll need a desktop rather than a laptop.  The heat of the most powerful CPU chips needs more space to dissipate than a laptop has.You could get another Dell; if you're really into gaming, the XPS or even more powerful Alienware lines have a lot to offer.The Dell Workstation line is their other alternative if gaming isn't your primary use case.  All of those can be found in their Outlet store for less money and greater value.  You're more limited in customizability but you do save some bucks.When selecting SSDs, be sure to watch their transfer rates.  Go for SATA III or 6Gb/s transfer rates.Think about getting mirrored hard drives; there are 4TB drives now.  A sweet setup would be fast SSD for the OS and programs, and big mirrored drives for data.If Dell is off the list, you could consider getting a machine custom made for you; this opens up super-quiet, or liquid-cooled, or other more exotic alternatives.  My favorite for this is http://www.pugetsystems.com/, I had them build me a theater PC that is inaudible, fast, and reliable.Be sure to get a number of USB 3 ports, you'll use them with the peripherals starting to utilize the bandwidth available."		"You could also try Dell's outlet store http://www.dell.com/outlet - look for the XPS gaming systems, go a couple of levels below"	"You could also try Dell's outlet store http://www.dell.com/outlet - look for the XPS gaming systems, go a couple of levels below top grade, and you'll have a very capable system"		@Daniel that's awesome feedback.

It's in the tech rumor mill, but I don't know how true it is. @parkplace has a good point about the ability to read the smaller display, so you might want to take that into consideration. I personally have an iPad3, but also have a Google Nexus 7 tablet.

If you're buying a la carte, simply choose your price point and pick one up.  No need to spend more than $100.Two thoughts:- Ink compatibility.  Your costs will come from ink in the long run (maybe even within a year).  Check what type of ink the printer takes, how many pages you can get and how much it costs (with a little math, you can get a cost-per-page).- If you buy a new computer, the store will usually throw a printer in for next to nothing.  The printer shouldn't drive your purchase, but if you're thinking of upgrading systems, this is something to keep in mind."		"Bah. Just pull the band-aid off and do it.

I had bought a Britax for my older one when he was younger not knowing much about car seats and that everyone had the Britax which they all thought was the best.  Since having my 2nd child, I bought the Graco 3-in-1 car seat and now I have 2 Graco's because we do car pools.  The Graco seat seems to be holding up better than the Britax. It handles spills very well and is not too hard to clean.  It is also very easy to install and remove, which I seem to do a lot.  I would also suggest that you take the car seat to the local police station and have them install it the first time so you can see how it is correctly and tightly installed.  Most local police stations offer this as a free service but not too many people know about it.  The police just want to see that kids are safe in the car they ride in.  The Graco Nautilus is currently on amazon for $139 (with free Prime shipping if you are a prime member).  Also, with amazon prime membership if you are not happy with the car seat, you don't have to pay return shipping.I hope this helps.Adam"		Just wanted to add and say thanks everyone!

There are models that are below $100 and/or you could get an older model versus the latest model. The ink is more pricey than others, but if you don't print much, it shouldnt be a big concern. You can always print using black and the lowest quality, which is fine for printing documents. I personally don't mind paying a little more for Canon ink because the printer itself, at least in my experience, lasts so much longer. Canons always come out on top in reliability surveys and are usually highly rated. I have never had a problem with my Canon printers. The only reason I recently bought a new one was for the upgrades, such as AirPrint, e-print, and other capabilities. HP printers, in my experience, have been least reliable. I have had several over the years and every one of them broke down in just a little over a year. This is why I think spending a little more on ink for a more reliable brand is well worth it, considering that I was having to buy a new printer every year.

If u like hassle free new cars every 3 years, low monthly payments, and don't need to mod the car, a lease is a great option.  If you plan to keep your car for a few years, want to minimize your long-term spend on cars, and want to mod the car, purchase works well.  It also depends a bit on the incentives.

From a financial point of view, the math tends to hinge upon the assumed depreciation rate (or residual value) implicit in the lease terms.  Since a buyer typically can get an auto loan for the purchase, a buyer can typically ease the monthly cash flows whether they purchase or lease (loan payments vs lease payments).  The primary difference in the math comes when you give the car back at the end of the lease (for $0) vs sell the car (for its actual residual value) or continue to hold it for additional years (further amortizing the original purchase price).  So, leasing is often a good idea from a hassle POV, but usually is only the optimal financial approach if the dealer has made very aggressive residual value assumptions and thus underpriced the lease."		"We have one, I have to look it up but we don't seem to use it much.

I don't know if common but even my bank tried to tell me about this option recently.  I would check with a good financial advisor, insurance broker or someone who comes highly recommended who can explain it fully to you (the bank rep was awful, didn't know too much about the product himself).  It's not that straightforward and it needs to be something that suits your situation.  Also, I forgot there is a limit of how much you can do for your kids...you or the other parent has to have whole life as well and the kids are limited to 25% of whatever your benefit is.  One big risk is if the insurance company folds, then they don't pay out, so look for the insurance companies with better credit rating.  I believe AXA was in trouble just a couple of years ago.  Insurance is kind of something you don't really want to use in the first place.  ;-)  In this case, i like that we have the option to borrow against the benefit.  The other risk is being misled by someone who isn't scrupulous or aware of the product...once you contribute a premium, you have to keep contributing....it's not like you can transfer to another insurance carrier.www.collegesavings.org might help you get some answers about 529's in general and for your state.

And as a reminder, the #1 investment you can make is paying off high interest debt (if you have any).  After that, starting that retirement fund early in life will pay off big time and probably more reliably/consistently than RE which right now is frozen in time with prices not moving much at all for the last few years."		"My gut doesn't love it b/c it's govt imposing stuff on people.

You are still very young with a lot of life choices spanning ahead of you, some of which may likely take you out of this area. You wouldn't want to be anchored with a house payment at this point which can tie up a fair chunk of your disposable income. You'll save more by renting and have a lot more flexibility. With renting, the most you'd lose if you have to move at a moment's notice is a month of rent. Pretty much peanuts compared to the potential loss and hassle that comes with a house or condo.
